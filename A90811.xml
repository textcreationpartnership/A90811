            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170316:4"/>but what the one ſayes, the other thinks; though I will not affirme it of all theſe, yet of many of them I dare be bold to ſay it, that notwithſtanding they can talke gloriouſly, and earneſtly contend for the true Religion whereof they profeſſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be, yet they doe not beleeve the truth of their religion. If it ſhould bee here, as it is frequently elſewhere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, how can this be, ſeeing they profeſs as they doe; they ſay they beleeve the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and if any ſhould ſay otherwiſe, they would be ready to offer him the Combate, or call a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud to the Magiſtrate for the ſevereſt puniſhment to be inflicted upon him; they have been Baptiſed, and at their Baptiſme engaged by a ſolemne promiſe and vow in their names, to forſake the Devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, to beleeve all the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith, to keep Gods holy Will and Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to walk in the ſame all the dayes of their life, which ſince they have been at age they have profeſſedly owned; the anſwer is ready,
<hi>Quid verba audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, facta cum videam?</hi> The moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne proteſtation is nothing, when by a
<pb facs="tcp:170316:5"/>continued contrary practice and courſe of life, it is manifeſtly contradicted. And yet this bath no ſuch wonderful thing in it, but that <hi>Tradition, Cuſtome,</hi> and the
<hi>Lawes</hi> of the Land where one lives are alone ſufficient to produce it. Did theſe men ſeriouſly conſider with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon what grounds they embrace the Chriſtian Religion rather than <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetaniſme,</hi> the Proteſtant Religion rather than <hi>Popery,</hi> I verily thinke their hearts would dictate no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but that they were borne and bred in this Religion, which being eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and countenanced by the Lawes of their Country, they embrace, as their fore-fathers have done in times paſt; ſo that the ſame grounds upon which they profeſs Chriſt here, were they in another Land would move them to deny him. They condemne the <hi>Jewes</hi> as the vileſt People that ever lived upon the face of the earth, becauſe they rejected and crucified Chriſt, but had they lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe <hi>Jewes,</hi> and ſeen a poore meane man, one in the forme of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant come amongſt them, endeavouring to alter their former Religion, and to aboliſh thoſe Rites and Cuſtomes which
<pb facs="tcp:170316:5"/>their Nation had for ſo many generations before uſed, would not the ſame ſpirit of enmity and oppoſition have acted in them, as did in thoſe <hi>Jewes</hi> againſt that man? Would they not have rejected him as a meer Impoſtor and Deceiver, and have continued their former profeſsion ſtill? Would they preſently have heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him, and become his Diſciples? If we may judge by what we frequently find in the like caſe, without doubt they would not.</p>
            <p>In the Primitive times, when the Goſpel-day began to dawn upon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan world, the Apoſtles had much to doe to make way for their Doctrine, many Curtaines were drawne to keep out the light which went with them, and the World contended to live in their <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> darkneſse ſtill; but afterwards the light breaking in upon thoſe clouds of darkneſſe which muffled them up, and opening their eyes to ſee the danger of their preſent condition, they reſolved to cheriſh the light, and to doe the buſineſſe of the day; but when once Religion was more generally profeſſed, in moſt places it begat a forme, and the Daughter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Mother, a bare forme and
<pb facs="tcp:170316:6"/>outward correſpondence was cryed up, but the power of godlineſſe was denied. And as it was then, ſo it hath been ever ſince, and is ſo at this day. There are very few Chriſtians amongſt Chriſtians, few, yea a very inconſiderable number a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Profeſſors, who doe in deed and in truth ſubmit to the Lord Jeſus, and take his yoke upon them. It is the great and maine buſineſſe that the Miniſters of the Goſpel have to doe, to convert men to the life and practiſe of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the name and ſhaddow whereof they doe only retain; this is their work as much almoſt here, as it would be were they amongſt
<hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> It is ſomewhat eaſie to bring men to an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward order and conformity with the reſt in attending publick Ordinances; gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they ruſh in upon them, and take it as a great affront to be kept back from any, but to prevaile with them, out of an equal reſpect to all the precepts of the Goſpel, one as well as another without partiality, to endeavour an univerſal Goſpel-obedience throughout the whole courſe of their lives, in all manner of converſation both towards God and man, is only net impoſsible. And no wonder,
<pb facs="tcp:170316:6"/>ſeeing they think it is of no concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either to the attaining of that good which they chiefly deſire, or the eſcaping. of that evil which they mainly fear. It is ſufficient for the carrying on of their worldly deſigne, which is all they aime at, living amongſt a people profeſsing themſelves Chriſtians, to whom the name of Heathen is abominable, to take upon them the like forme of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that others doe, but as for any thing more, ſeeing it is of no ſuch advantage in this World, and they neither hope nor feare for any thing in the World to come, they doe not regard it. This is one reaſon why, when we have done all that we can, we cannot get them beyond a forme, and that not the ſtrictest neither. Men will never be under the power of that, the truth wherof they do not beleeve; but this is not the only reaſon, for ſome of them doe beleeve, I meane with an Hiſtorical faith, the truth of what is told them in the Goſpel, and yet for all that live as wretched wicked lives as if they beleeved it not; the cauſe of it is their preſumption and carnal ſecurity, into which they argue themſelves by a falſe reaſoning; That there is a <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170316:7"/>they beleeve, but they think they ſhall not be ſhut out of it; and that there is a
<hi>Hell,</hi> but they hope they ſhall never come there; though they walk on after the imagination of their owne heart, in the allowed omiſsion of ſome one or more known duties injoyned in the Scripture, and commiſsion of ſome one or more known ſins therein forbidden, yet they promiſe themſelves peace, as they, <hi>Deut. 29.19.</hi> they hope they ſhall doe as well as others when they come to dye, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they read or heare of in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the contrary notwithſtanding. There are multitudes of theſe preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ones amongſt us, and they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther openly profane, ſuch as have not eſcaped the pollutions of the world, but tumble and wallow like Swine in the common puddle, that run to all exceſſe of riot, and declare their ſin as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and hide it not, that let looſe the reins to their luſts, and run a career af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Prince of this world in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon road way that the Scripture tells them leads to Hell, as open notorious drunkards, ſwearers, blaſphemers, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, filthy talkers, ſcoffers, prophaners of the Lords day, &amp;c. or ſecretly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
<pb facs="tcp:170316:7"/>ſuch as under a garb of civility, or more than ordinary profeſsion hide the fouleſt wickedneſſe, ſuch as ſin in the ſecret Chamber, as thoſe that are given to ſelf-pollutions, that defile themſelves by themſelves; cloſe Adulterers, and Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſes, that have Husbands and Wives to hide their uncleanneſſe; cloſe tiplers and drunkards, who will now and then ſhoot into an Ale-houſe, but be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily drunk in their owne houſes; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Dice-players, and Gameſters, that ſquander away their time, and money, when they are out of the Magiſtrates reach; ſuch as have not renounced the hidden things of diſhoneſty, but will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly couſen and cheat, defraud, and goe beyond their brethren; one would wonder that any of theſe ſhould enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine one thought of entring into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that they doe not rather feare every moment leaſt God ſhould ſtrike them with a Thunder-bolt into Hell; but uſually it is ſo, that even ſuch as theſe have as confident an expectation of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in the world to come as the beſt; ask them, and they will tell you, they hope to be ſaved as well as the proudeſt Preciſian of you all, they have it almoſt
<pb facs="tcp:170316:8"/>at the end of every ſentence, <hi>As I hope to be ſaved;</hi> what it is that imboldens them in this manner, and makes them thus foole-hardy, may be eaſily imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1</hi> Some confuſed thoughts of Gods mercy; they think he that made them will not damne them, they cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine when it comes to be their own caſe, that he can be ſo cruel to his Creatures, as to torment them eternally in Hell. To ſhew the particular workings of their thoughts here:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1</hi> They think only on his Mercy, and not at all on his Juſtice, they think hee is all mercy, and love, and goodneſſe, and the thoughts that they have of this, quite ſwallow up all thoughts of his juſtice.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> They cull out many of thoſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that ſpeak of the love and goodneſs of God, as that he is love, and dwels in love; that he is ſlow to anger, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in mercy, and doth not willingly grieve the children of men, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3</hi> They argue from Gods goodneſſe in this world, that he will not be otherwiſe, to them at least, in the world to come; he is good unto all, and his tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are over all his works; he cauſeth
<pb facs="tcp:170316:8"/>his Sun to ſhine upon the juſt, and unjuſt alſo, they ſee that he doth not puniſh when provoked, but is long-ſuffering, and full of forbearance. Hence,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4</hi> They think that when Miniſters preach Damnation, they doe but pry into Gods ſecrets, and vent their owne paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and know not of what ſpirit they be of. Thus they labour to ſecure their hearts, but if this will not doe, then</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> They fly to ſome of the Promiſes, never minding the conditions that are annexed to them; though they be Doggs, yet they will be ſnatching at the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens bread. And now they thinke they are well provided for, they now think that they beleeve, for faith is grounded upon the Promiſes, and the Scripture ſaith, he that beleeveth ſhall be ſaved. Now come to theſe men after this, and tell them of the threatnings, why</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1</hi> They think the threanings will not be executed, they think there is ſome uſe of them <hi>in terrorem,</hi> to over-awe men a little that they might not be wicked over much, but that God never threatned with intent to execute; or if they muſt be executed, then</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2</hi> It is but upon thoſe that deſpiſe the
<pb facs="tcp:170316:9"/>Promiſes, but for their parts they relye on them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3</hi> However it be, they think they muſt not deſpair, but be of a good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and hope to the laſt breath, and therefore notwithſtanding all the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, they have theſe and theſe promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and here they will hold faſt. If this doe not fully comfort them, then</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3</hi> They look into themſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that though they be guilty of a great many ſins, yet they are but infirmities and failings, for they often hear that to fall into ſuch and ſuch ſinful Acts, may conſiſt with grace, and for their parts they cannot help it; they ſwear indeed, but it is but now and then when they are provoked; they are ſometimes drunk, but it is but now and then when they are drawn in by good company, and they doe forget themſelves are they be aware, and it is not ſo much many times, only they have weaker braines than others, and men thinke they be drunke when they are not.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>4</hi> They conſider the examples of godly men in Scripture, who have been guilty of the ſame ſins, as <hi>Noah, Lot, David, Peter,</hi> &amp;c. and hence they
<pb facs="tcp:170316:9"/>argue, that every man hath his failings, and the beſt muſt have their graines of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance. And the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>in many things we offend all;</hi> and, <hi>If any man ſaith he hath no ſin, he is a lyer;</hi> and now they can hold no longer, but preſently fly out upon other Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, as meer pretenders to perfection and Saintſhip, which they hold to bee a thing impoſsible on this ſide Heaven, and ſo fall to ſcoffing, and jeering, and rayling upon thoſe that live more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to the rules of their Religion than themſelves. Hence,</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5</hi> They think that all thoſe, many of them at leaſt, that doe condemne them, live in the ſame ſins ſecretly, or in as bad of another kind; though they will not ſwear, ſay they, they will lye; and though they will not be drunk, they will play the Gluttons, and that they cannot endure good fellowſhip with the reſt of their Neighbours, it is only from pride, and Self-conceitedneſſe; Stand off, touch me not, I am holier than thou. Hence again they conclude, as for perfection, no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man is capable of it, it is but in vain to endeavour after it, or pretend unto it. If this doth not quiet their guilty conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, then</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb facs="tcp:170316:10"/>
               <hi>6</hi> They hope they ſhall repent, and then they are ſure all will bee well, then there will bee no fear, for, <hi>At what time ſoever a ſinner repents, &amp;c.</hi> As for example, the Thief upon the Croſſe, therefore if they can but cry God mercy before the laſt gaſp, they doubt not but they ſhall make a good end. But,</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>7</hi> At the worſt, come the worſt that can come, they ſhall doe as well as others, and they think that others have ſouls to ſave as well as they, and why ſhould they fear more than other men? They conſider, that not only the generality of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, but many of the wiſe and learned, eſpecially of the great and mighty, doe commonly practiſe the ſame things, or as bad, or worſe, and they think if there were any danger they would bee ware of it; howſoever to make all ſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide their conſtant attending of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Ordinances,</p>
            <p n="8">
               <hi>8</hi> They will pray in their Cloſets, and in their Families, and repeat to their people the Sermons they have written, and ſing Pſalmes; and beſides, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they will put themſelves to a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary pennance, as to faſt ſuch a day yearly, it may be weekly, or to part with
<pb facs="tcp:170316:10"/>ſome gaineful imployment, or to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a great ſum of money to good uſes, as ſerves beſt for the quieting of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, fearfully vexed with the guilt, it may be, of ſome particular ſin above all others, that they live in.</p>
            <p>Now, Readers, if you be any of you of this number, as I ſuppoſe ſome of you be, give me leave in a few words a little to expoſtulate, and reaſon with you; Yet beleeve the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and in them ye think ye have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life; ſearch them therefore and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe them diligently, view every line from the beginning to the end, ponder every word, and ſee if upon the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act and curious obſervation, you can find the leaſt ſyllable of any comfort, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for any one that allowes himſelf in any one known ſin. They ſpeak much indeed of Gods mercy to ſinners, but to what Sinners? are they not belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and repenting ſinners only? and who are they, but ſuch as in their purpoſes and endeavours turne from every known ſin? Doe they ſay, he will be merciful to any preſumptuous ſinners? to any ſuch as hold faſt deceit, and refuſe to returne? Hear what they ſay, <hi>Whoſo
<pb facs="tcp:170316:11"/>confeſſeth his ſins and forſaketh them, ſhall have mercy, but he that covereth them ſhall not proſper,</hi> Prov. <hi>28.13. For the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all ungodlineſs:</hi> mark it, <hi>all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and unrighteouſneſs of men,</hi> namely of ſuch men, <hi>who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> Rom.
<hi>1.18.</hi> You think God is merciful, true, but is hee not alſo juſt? is he not alſo wrathful and revengeful? See how the Prophet deſcribes him, <hi>God is jealous, and the Lord revengeth, the Lord reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and is furious, the Lord will take vengeance on his adverſaries, and he reſerveth wrath for his enemies, Nah. 1.2.</hi> It followes indeed in the next verſe,
<hi>The Lord is ſlow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> but mark what comes after, <hi>and will not at all acquit the wicked;</hi> where the Lord proclaimes his Name in this manner unto Moſes, <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, long ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion and ſin,</hi> Exod. <hi>34.6.</hi> even there he alſo addes, <hi>and that will
<pb facs="tcp:170316:11"/>by no meanes cleare the guilty, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting the iniquity of the Fathers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Children, and upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens children, to the third, and to the fourth generation,</hi> verſ. <hi>7.</hi> God beares with you now, and is good unto you, you think he will deale thus with you in the world to come, and therefore you ſin with the more boldneſs; but hear what he ſaith, <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done, and I kept ſilence, thou thoughteſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf, but I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thee, and ſet them in order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine eyes. Now conſider this ye that forget God, leſt I teare you in peices and there be none to deliver,</hi> Pſal. <hi>50.21, 22. Patientia laeſa tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit in furorem.</hi> The long ſuffering and goodneſs of God being abuſed, will at length grow into fury, and then woe be unto all ſuch as ſhall be found in their ſins; the more of the goodneſs of God hath been ſpent upon them here, the more of his wrath ſhall be poured out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them hereafter. <hi>What if God, willing to ſhew his wrath, and to make his power knowne, endured with much long ſuffering the veſſels
<pb facs="tcp:170316:12"/>of wrath fitted to deſtruction,</hi> Rom. <hi>9.22.</hi> Therefore <hi>thinkeſt thou, O man, that thou ſhalt eſcape the Judgement of God? Or deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſs, and forbearance, and long ſuffering, not knowing that the goodneſs of God leadeth thee to repentance? but after thy hardneſs and impenitent heart, treaſureſt up wrath againſt the day of Wrath, and revelation of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgement of God, who will render to every man according to his deeds; to them who by patient continuance in well-doing ſeek for glory, honour, and immortality, eternal life; but to them that are contentious, and doe not obey the truth, but obey unrighteouſneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and wrath, tribulation and anguiſh upon every ſoule of man that doth evil, of the Jew firſt, and alſo of the Gentile,</hi> Rom.
<hi>2.3-9.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You thinke that he that made you will not damne you; But what ſaith Iſaiah? <hi>It is a people of no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, therefore hee that made them will not have mercy on them; and he that formed them will
<pb facs="tcp:170316:12"/>ſhew them no favour,</hi> Iſa. <hi>27.11.</hi> You thinke God cannot be ſo cruel, but if yee walke according to the courſe of this World in the luſts of your fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh, and of the mind, and dye ſo, I tell you, he will not only damne you, but damne you with delight. <hi>Ah,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will eaſe me of mine adverſaries, and avenge me of mine enemies,</hi> Iſa. <hi>1.24. Becauſe I have called and yee refuſed, I have ſtretched forth mine hand and no man regarded, but yee have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; I alſo will laugh at your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, I will mock when your fear cometh, when your feare cometh as a deſolation, and your deſtruction cometh as a Whirlewind, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon you,</hi> Prov. <hi>1.24-27.</hi> Your flying unto the Promiſes while in this condition will doe you no good, for there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in all the Book of God belongs unto any upon any other termes but the renouncing and abandoning of every knowne ſin. Why doe you look to the Promiſes, and doe not mind the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb facs="tcp:170316:13"/>of them? If God promiſe to be merciful to ſuch as beleeve and repent, what is that to you, ſo long as you doe neither? If God promiſe abſolutely to work the condition in ſome, what is that to you, ſo long as there is no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that hee hath wrought it in you?</p>
            <p>God hath no where promiſed to ſave men in their ſins, he hath appointed holineſs as a neceſſary antecedent to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happineſs; for <hi>without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs no man ſhall ſee God,</hi> Hebrews <hi>12.14.</hi> If the Promiſes be yours, whoſe then are the Threatnings? who are they againſt whom the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven in the threatnings of his Word, but ſuch as you who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs? <hi>For the Law is not made for a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man, but for the lawleſs and diſobedient, for the ungodly and for ſinners, for unholy and prophane, for murderers of Fathers, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of Mothers, for Man ſlayers, for Whoremongers, for them that defile themſelves with man-kind, for men-ſtealers, for lyars, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured perſons, and if there bee any
<pb facs="tcp:170316:13"/>other thing that is contrary to ſound Doctrine, according to the glorious Goſpel of the bleſſed God, 1</hi> Tim. <hi>1.9, 10, 11.</hi> When the threatnings ſpeake ſo plaine, naming the very ſins whereof you know your ſelves guilty, as allowing your ſelves in them, why doe you not make application, and ſay, we are the men? Oh! what ſhall we doe to eſcape the Judgements threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned?</p>
            <p>Doe you not thinke that God is as true in his threatnings as in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes? Remember how he dealt with the old World, how with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs; <hi>For if the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfaſt, and every tranſgreſſion received a juſt recompence of reward, how ſhall we eſcape,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?</hi> Heb. <hi>2.2. Let us therefore feare leaſt a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe being left us of entring into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeeme to come ſhort of it, for unto us was the Goſpel preached as well as unto them, but the Word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched did not profit them, being not mixed with faith in them
<pb facs="tcp:170316:14"/>that heard it,</hi> Heb. <hi>4.1, 2.</hi> Some doe not ſo much as beleeve the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to bee true, it may be you doe, and yet this is not enough to prove you to be as you think you bee, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; this is not the beleeving to which Salvation is promiſed, for the Devils beleeve both Promiſes and Threatnings to bee true, and doe ſomewhat more, it may bee, than you doe, they <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and tremble,</hi> James <hi>2.19.</hi> and yet ſhall never be ſaved: God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>reſerved them in everlaſting Chaines under darkneſs, unto the Judgement of the great day,</hi> Jude, verſ. <hi>6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You beleeve the promiſes of the Goſpel to be true, but you doe not ſo beleeve as to obey the Goſpel; you doe not ſo beleeve as to cloſe with the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> as he is therein tendred to you, to bee your <hi>Prophet</hi> to teach and inſtruct you, and your
<hi>King</hi> to rule and governe you, as well as your <hi>Prieſt</hi> to make ſatisfaction for you.</p>
            <p>You walk on ſtill after the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of your owne hearts, and doe your owne wills, and therefore doe
<pb facs="tcp:170316:14"/>not beleeve, therefore you have no ground to hope that you ſhall bee ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for you are yet in your ſinnes, which, notwithſtanding you account them but infirmities, are reigning ſinnes, for as much as you <hi>yeeld your members as inſtruments of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs unto ſinne, but doe not yeeld your ſelves unto God,</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans <hi>6.13. Know you not that to whom you yeeld your ſelves ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to obey, his ſervants you are to whom you obey; whether of ſinne unto death, or of obedience unto life,</hi> verſ. <hi>16.</hi> and doe you not obey ſin when you willingly and readily fulfill its commands? When you goe at its bidding, and come at its beckning? Will you call this an infirmity? Will you call this a failing? It is but an infirmity, and yet you ſinne willingly; Willingly? nay you ſinne wilfully, like a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of mad-men running on head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in the wayes of ſinne, againſt all checks of Conſcience, and gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying of your underſtandings.</p>
            <p>Your rebellion witneſſeth againſt you, your ſtubbornneſs teſtifieth to your

You have alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether broken the yoke, and burſt the bonds. The Lord hath ſtricken you, but you have not grieved; hee hath conſumed you, but you have refuſed to receive correction; you have made your face harder than a rock, you have refuſed to returne.</hi> How then can you ſay, <hi>you cannot help it?</hi> Behold, you <hi>ſpeake and doe evil as you can,</hi> you doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil <hi>with both hands earneſtly,</hi> adding ſinne unto ſin, as if you could never ſinne enough, <hi>waxing worſe and worſe,</hi> and ſtill <hi>encreaſing unto more ungodlineſs.</hi> You doe not ſo much as reſolve againſt every known ſin, but your hearts <hi>are fully ſet in you to doe wickedly;</hi> you doe not watch againſt it before it be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but run your ſelves upon temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and after it is committed, are you <hi>aſhamed? nay, you are not at all aſhamed, neither can you bluſh;</hi> none of you <hi>ſmiteth upon the thigh,</hi>

            <p>But you hope you ſhall repent too at laſt; at laſt? Why doe you not endeavour it at preſent? Doe you think you can repent when you will? or have you any engagement upon God, that whenſoever you pleaſe, hee ſhould work it in you? <hi>Qui promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit poenitenti veniam, non promiſit differenti poenitentiam.</hi> He that hath promiſed to grant a pardon to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, hath no where promiſed to grant repentance to him that delayes to repent. How can you expect it? you have rather cauſe to feare, that hee will <hi>give you over to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate minde,</hi> Romans <hi>1.28.</hi> and <hi>to your owne hearts luſts,</hi> Pſalme
<hi>81.12.</hi> that you may live all your dayes in your ſinnes, and at laſt <hi>dye in them,</hi> John <hi>8.24.</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bee <hi>damned</hi> for them, <hi>2 Theſ. 2.12. Wherefore as the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, To day if yee will

            </p>
            <p>There is a time even in this life, after which God will ſhew no mercy; it is poſsible to ſinne away <hi>a day of Grace</hi> long before you dye, and then though you <hi>call upon him,</hi> hee will <hi>not anſwer;</hi> though you <hi>ſeek him early,</hi> you <hi>ſhall not finde him:</hi> for that you <hi>hated knowledge, and did not chuſe the fear of the Lord; you would none of his counſell,</hi> you <hi>deſpiſed all his reproof,</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhall <hi>eate of the fruit of your owne way,</hi> and <hi>be filled with</hi> your <hi>owne devices; for the turning away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay</hi> you, and <hi>the proſperity of fooles ſhall deſtroy you,</hi> Prov. <hi>1.28 - 32.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware therefore of going on any longer againſt your light, preſently abandon every known ſin, practiſe every known duty, neceſsity is laid upon you, and woe be to you if you doe it not.</p>
            <p>Though you ſhould make never ſo glorious a profeſsion, though you ſhould performe never ſo many duties, if
<pb facs="tcp:170316:16"/>you ſtick but at one, ſo that you will not performe that too, it is impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but you ſhould bee ſhut out of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; as you may ſee in the Story of the <hi>Young man,</hi> Luke <hi>18.22.</hi> And though you ſhould abandon never ſo many ſinnes, if you ſticke but at one, ſo that you will not abandon that too, it is impoſsible but you ſhould bee turned into Hell, out of which there is no redemption, there you muſt lye, and lye to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>Thinke upon this, and then ſee, whether it bee beſt to gratifie the fleſh, either by the forbearance of any known duty, or practiſe of any known ſinne, as you doe. Let not the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the generality of the World move you, better goe to Heaven with a few, than to Hell in the crowd.</p>

            <head>To not only the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Reader, but to any Reader that hath a mind, or if not, that hee may have a mind to be a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and that not only in ſhew but in truth, not only in word but in deed.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Elf-denial! <hi>bleſs us,</hi> what a ſtrange hard word, what a prodigious and monſtrous thing is this? ſaith poor ſelfiſh man; <hi>Self-denial forſooth, what!</hi> am not I my ſelf? Doe not I my ſelf live, and live for my ſelf? How can I bee a man, and put off the man? How can I be my ſelf, and deny my ſelf? Is it not to be beſide my ſelf <hi>(and that's to be mad)</hi> to be without my ſelf? Thus <hi>(alas!)</hi> doth poor man play the foole in wit, he rageth and is confident; as if there were ſuch good reaſon for, and ſuch good ſenſe
<pb facs="tcp:170316:18"/>in ſelf-ſeeking, as that the Doctrine of Self-denial were but a Paradox, yea an abſurdity, a contradiction, and very non-ſenſe. He highly applaudes even to admiration, that
<hi>(by him miſtaken and miſ-interpreted)</hi> ſaying of <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 9.12. if thou bee wiſe thou ſhalt be wiſe for thy ſelf; and <hi>for his part,</hi> he will praiſe none but them that doe well unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.18. he will admit none to the name of wiſe and worthy perſons, but diſmiſs them for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of un-intelligent, in-ſignificant and poore ſpirited Sneakes, yea for dull Sots, witleſs Dolts, and God Almighties Fools, that preferre not themſelves before every thing elſe.</p>
            <p>Man indeed is ſo dear to himſelf, that <hi>Self-intereſt</hi> ſeemes to be his <hi>all in all;</hi> the firſt mover, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and center of all he doth; the principle
<hi>from,</hi> the rule <hi>by,</hi> the end <hi>for</hi> which he acts any good, or forbears to act any evil, and this is natural to him; but though <hi>Nature</hi> be maſter of this Art, and can teach man to ſeek his owne good, yet <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is not ſuch a Doctor in Divinity,
<pb facs="tcp:170316:18"/>nor hath attained to ſuch a degree of learning and wiſedome, as to teach man wherein his true good and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt lies; ſo that it is no wonder that poore man is filled with indignation at ſuch a word, <hi>much more at ſuch a thing</hi> as Self-denial is.
<hi>Alas!</hi> in what a ſad, uneaſie, and reſtleſs condition muſt poor man be that hath a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo freely inclined, and ſtrongly addicted to his owne intereſt, and yet is not owner of a judgement and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion able and acute enough to tell him what it is, and how it may be attained; ſo that did not God, who is a God of grace and mercy, take pitty on poore man
<hi>(for ſo I muſt alwayes call him)</hi> he would doe nothing but undoe himſelf, and that by ſeeking himſelf.</p>
            <p>But God <hi>(God bleſſed, and to bee bleſſed for evermore)</hi> who is a Lover of Soules, and the preſerver of men, who would not that they ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but that all men ſhould come to the knowledge of the truth and bee ſaved, God I ſay, hath ſhewn <hi>(in and by his Word)</hi> what is mans good, and wherein his true intereſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb facs="tcp:170316:19"/>doth conſiſt, how hee may love, ſeek, and ſave himſelf, which is ſo dear unto him; beſide (<hi>ex a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundanti,</hi> which is a wonder) God invites, and <hi>(if I may ſo ſpeak)</hi> courts man hereunto; not that hee needs man, for he is God happy for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
<hi>whether man be ſaved or dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> but by the moſt obligeing, and moſt indearing way in the World, that man himſelf may be the gainer, and injoy himſelf in the injoyment of a good infinitely better than himſelf, even God himſelf. When God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts and perſwades man to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>why is it?</hi> but oh that hee would heare and keep my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements always for his good; when God dehorts and diſſwades from ſin, <hi>why is it?</hi> but that man might not wrong and injure himſelf; God hath ſo twiſted his own glory &amp; our good together, that he expects no ſervice from us, which ſhall not be more a ſervice to our ſelves: God hath ſo graciouſly ordered the matter, that the very meanes of our happineſs is a part of it, our duty a priviledge, and our work wages; ſo that wee
<pb facs="tcp:170316:19"/>cannot doe our ſelves a greater cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, than in doing God the beſt ſervice, our greateſt intereſt lies in ſurrendring our ſelves wholly unto God, to feare God, and keep his Commandements is the whole <hi>(as duty, ſo happineſs)</hi> of man, for all the reſt <hi>(that is under the Sun)</hi> is but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent and unprofitable, yea <hi>(to call it by its owne name)</hi> very vanity, and vexation of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>We doe but miſcall and flatter the World, <hi>yea abuſe our ſelves alſo,</hi> when we attribute to it, and adorn it with the fine words, and ſpecious titles of Grandeure, and Gallantry, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and bravery, delight and delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, pleaſure and prettineſs, honour and happineſs; alas, theſe are but pompous ſhewes, glittering and gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy nothings: the roſineſs of the moſt glaring and charming beauty, the whiſtling of the moſt ſilken bravery, the chinking of bewitching white and yellow duſt which we call gold and ſilver, the ſparkling Crownes which doe tempt and captivate: the amorous, the genteel, <hi>otherwiſe proud,</hi> the covetous, and the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:170316:20"/>Sons of men, will one day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be but a cheat of Fancy, and that ſuch as have been enamoured of them have but deceived, and jugled themſelves out of true happineſs for a falſe one, and eſpouſed themſelves to a meer paultry vanity, which if it be any thing, is a ſomething worſe than nothing.</p>

            <p>By all this it moſt clearly appears that Grace is mans glory, that the ſervice of God is mans freedome, that Self-denial is mans advantage. Oh Divine thing, <hi>Grace!</hi> how would the Sons of men make Court to thee, did they but ſee what a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying, what an innobling, and
<hi>to ſpeake as truly as highly in Scripture ſenſe,</hi> what a deifying thing thou art.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:170316:21"/>Surely as Reaſon is mans ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance above bruits, grace is mans advance above men,
<hi>other men and himſelf,</hi> for it makes a man more a man, and more than a man; and though man was Created little low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Angells, yet as a new Creature, hee ſhall not onely bee like and equal to the Angells, but <hi>(it ſeems)</hi> is already above them, they being his ſervitours, and ſpirits ſent forth to Miniſter to him, and for his good. <hi>Yea further,</hi> it makes man like God himſelf, for what is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe? but God-likeneſs; that, whereby wee are as ſo many living Images, and lively pictures of the Divine nature.</p>
            <p>How highly concerning is it then to put off our ſelf that wee may be our own, Not to bee in our ſelves, that in God <hi>(as naturally, ſo ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)</hi> wee may live, move, and have our beings: for clearly, man is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truely his own nor himſelf, but when hee is Gods; <hi>Dead and loſt is his Motto,</hi> all the while he is a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the life of God, <hi>Luke</hi>
15.32. Man is not himſelf when hee goes
<pb facs="tcp:170316:22"/>from God, <hi>that is,</hi> when hee ſins and ſeeks himſelf, and man then comes to himſelf <hi>as tis ſaid of the Prodigal,</hi> when hee comes to God; ſo that if man will but do himſelf the right to bee wiſe for, and good to himſelf, it muſt be by this Chriſtian Art and knack of Self-Denial; not making his own underſtanding his guide,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 3.5, 6, 7. <hi>For he that will bee wiſe muſt become a fool,</hi> not mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own will his rule, nor fleſh-pleaſing, or <hi>which is all one</hi> ſelf-pleaſing his end; but reſigning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the conduct of God, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God, devoting himſelf to do all hee doth to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, hee may finde himſelf in not ſeeking himſelf, and live altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to himſelf, in not living at all to himſelf.</p>
            <p>But dear Reader, This Treatiſe, <hi>which I commend to thy peruſal and practice,</hi> will further, and more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquaint thee with this thing; the nature and excellency of it, as to which, and the Author my friend, I think it improper, <hi>becauſe needleſs,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170316:22"/>to ſay any thing. I ſhall therefore adde but a little more, and commend this, the book, and thee to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God.</p>
            <p>Go Self-Denial, go and proſper; I am ſure, thou wert once (and didſt then make a glorious triumphant ſhew) in the world, when Chriſt, our dear and bleſſed Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was here; and though thou have been a ſtranger for a long time, not only in this our
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> but in moſt parts of the World, yet me thinkes thou ſhouldſt bee welcome for his ſake; it ſeems to mee to bee highly and hugely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeing, that if Chriſt denyed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <hi>(his glory)</hi> for us, wee ſhould deny our ſelfes <hi>(our ſinnes)</hi> for him, yea, I may ſay for our ſelves; ſurely they will do but little for Chriſt, that will not for his ſake bee content to bee happy. Moreover, <hi>Oh thou moſt rare Self-Denial!</hi> this addes to thy beauty and takingneſs, and ſhould indear thee to all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing world, that thou commeſt forth in ſeaſon, for when ſhould Self-Denial bee <hi>Preacht</hi> and <hi>Preſt,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:170316:23"/>but when men that ſay they are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ſavour the things that are of men, and not the things that are of God; then twas <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. that Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, if any will come after mee, let him deny himſelf. <hi>Shall I adde,</hi> that ſome graces and duties are to bee acted but now and then, but this alwaies, a Chriſtian ſhould bee often in Self-Tryall, &amp;c. but alwaies in Self-Denial; for when other duties are but as Letters, this muſt bee as the vowel to give it a ſound, and make it a word, there cannot bee a Monoſyllable ſpelt in Religion, without this vowel of Self-Denial.</p>
            <p>In a word, to diſabuſe the miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken World, which look upon this as a puſillanimous and diſpiriting Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, a puleing quality fitted onely to little ſoules; <hi>If God and Reaſon may be heard to ſpeak,</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more becomming brave Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits than Self-Denial; it argues the greatneſſe of their courage, that they are Perſons of high and noble Soules, who can give the Denial to that which hath been born and bred
<pb facs="tcp:170316:23"/>with them, <hi>and is therefore ſo near and dear to them,</hi> rather than adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to break the Command of their Lord and Soveraign; Tis effeminate and worſe, it hath nothing of maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and manly in it, to indulge and gratify ſelfiſh inclinations, and fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appetites, hath not God ſaid it? hee that ruleth his ſpirit, <hi>that ſubdues and denies himſelf,</hi> is better, <hi>a perſon of more honour, and of higher command,</hi> than hee that takes and rules a City; and he that dares not undertake ſuch an Heroick Conqueſt, is not worthy the name of a ſtout and gallant man. How many valiant Sword-men of the World, have ſhewn themſelves meer cowards, who have come Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors out of the field, and then lived, and
<hi>(it may bee)</hi> dyed baſe ſlaves to a luſt at home; As one ſaid of a great
<hi>Romane</hi> Captain (who as hee rode in his triumphant Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot through <hi>Rome,</hi> had his eyes fixed on a Courtizan that walkt the ſtreets) Behold, how this goodly Captain that hath Conquered ſuch Potent Armies, is himſelf conquered by one ſilly woman; <hi>hee might have
<pb facs="tcp:170316:24"/>better ſaid,</hi> by his own luſt.</p>
            <p>Well then, if thou wilt ſave thy ſelf generouſly, away with thy ſelfe; for hee that will looſe himſelfe ſhall ſave himſelfe, but hee that will ſave himſelf ſhall looſe himſelf, and then, what wilt thou do? but pule and ſneak, complain and lament, with ſuch a ſad out-cry as this,
<q>
                  <l>Ah! my too much of mee, mee much annoy'd</l>
                  <l>And my ſelf-plenty, my poor ſelf deſtroyed.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude all, let mee beſeech thee <hi>for Chriſts ſake, and thine own ſouls ſake,</hi> to learn not onely the name and notion, but the thing; and not to pleaſe thy ſelf with the word, without the ſpirit, power and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Self-Denial. Now that the Author, thy and my ſelf, and all the world may put Self-Denial in practice, and ſo as to abound and perſevere therein to the end, is the hearty Prayer of the Authors, thine and every mans Friend and Servant in Chriſt Jeſus,</p>

Herein our Saviour then acts the part of a diſcreet General, who when Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntaries offer themſelves to the ſervice, lets them know beforehand, the difficulties they ſhall bee put upon afterwards, <hi>q d.

20.22</note> ſons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> when they deſired to ſit with him in his Kingdome,
<hi>Are yee able to drink of the cup that I ſhall drink of? and to bee baptized with the baptiſme that I am baptized with?</hi> If you be not you deſire a vain thing. So here, Are yee able to deny your ſelves? are yee able to bear the Croſs? If you be not, your coming to mee is to no purpoſe, for this you muſt do, thus you muſt ſuffer; <hi>Come after me</hi>] <hi>i. e.</hi> as my Diſciple, or Scholar, learn and practice the duties of a Chriſtian. An alluſion to the cuſtome of Scholars in following their Maſters, <hi>q. d.</hi> If yee will bee my Diſciple, yee muſt turn over a new leaf, and take out a new leſſon, I ſhall teach you that ye never heard of in all your lives before; you have been a long while trained up in other Schools, under other teachers, but never had the leaſt inkling of this kinde of learning. But now if yee will be <hi>my</hi> Diſciples, if you <hi>will take it upon</hi> you to come after mee, this yee muſt learn, this yee muſt do: Yee may follow others long enough, and follow Self too, Self leads both the Maſter and the Scholars, but if you will come after <hi>mee,</hi> you muſt deny your ſelves. This is a <hi>ſtrain</hi> of ſpiritual learning, far ſurpaſſing any
<hi>humane</hi> teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170316:30"/>in the World, for though many of the <hi>Heathen Philoſophers</hi> have ſpoken bravely, and gallantly of diverſe Morral and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical truths (as they are called) yet their whole <hi>frame of Notions</hi> was built up with ſo much <hi>affectation,</hi> that they plainly ſhewed they never had acquaintance with this leſſon, which would have been the Crown and glory of all their other wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. The ſtreams ariſe no higher than the Fountain from whence they iſſue forth, whatſoever they invented, whatſoever they practiſed, had its ſpring and original from Self, and therefore they could not aſcend higher than Self in any thing they did; ſo that even <hi>Diogenes</hi> that <hi>ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cynick</hi> trampled upon
<hi>Plato's</hi> pride with greater pride. This Doctrin then of Self-denial which Chriſt here teacheth, is not from man, it is not a Doctrin which Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdome teacheth (Self, will not teach Self-denial) but a Doctrine that cometh down from above — <hi>è coelo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendit,</hi>

In <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. verſ. 10. the Lord Jeſus is called, the <hi>Captain of their Salvation,</hi> whom God hath appointed to be brought to glory, becauſe he leads them through the midſt of their enemies, from a
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170316:30"/>ſtate of ſin and miſery here, to a ſtate of holineſs and happineſs hereafter. He goes on fighting before them, and they come on fighting after him, till all their Spiritual enemies being quite vanquiſhed and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, hee bring them triumphantly into heaven.</p>
               <p>Two things then I conceive are here meant by coming after Chriſt. Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming after him in the Regeneration here, and in the Reſurrection hereafter; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is our duty, the latter our priviledge. Both theſe we have, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.28, 29. verſ. the former expreſſed, the latter implyed.

<hi>Copulative,</hi> as well as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of the Law; the Law in the <hi>ſanction</hi> of it was <hi>diſ-junctive,</hi> it was, <hi>Do this or dye;</hi> but in the <hi>injunction</hi> it was

Many <hi>come after</hi> Chriſt but <hi>follow</hi> Self; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny come for the things of Chriſt but not for Chriſt himſelf; for the Loaves, but not for the love of Chriſt;

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:170316:35"/>Thoſe that treat of this ſubject, doe uſually make mention of divers other Selfs, and accordingly make ſo many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſorts of Self-denial. Some diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it into circumſcribed Self, which is a mans perſon, Divided-ſelf which is his wife; Multiplied-ſelf, which is his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; Civil-ſelf in reſpect of his Civil rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and worldly enjoyments; Sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in reſpect of his corruptions, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral-ſelf in reſpect of his good works.</p>
               <p>Others make a tripartite diviſion of it, into Natural, Sinful, and Renewed-ſelf. Natural-ſelf they conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1 In regard of being and ſubſtance, importing our life, together with all the powers, and faculties of nature, as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, will, and affections, the ſenſes and members of the body.</p>
               <p n="2">2 In regard of well-being, or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of this life, which are either,</p>
               <p n="1">1 External relations;</p>
               <p>Or 2 Special gifts, and endowments, as Learning, Wiſdome, Power, and all other abilities of minde and body.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Common ends, which all men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for, as riches, honours, and pleaſures. Renewed-ſelf they make to bee a mans duties, holineſs, and obedience, his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and the graces of the Spirit: But thus one may make all the things in the world ones ſelf.</p>
               <p>That which is to bee denied in all theſe,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170316:35"/>is but one and the ſame thing, and that is the <hi>Old man,</hi> which would have ſomething to do in all of them, contrary to the will of God, which muſt not bee ſuffered. The <hi>Old man</hi> would have us ſave our lives, when God would have us loſe them; hee would have us keep our eſtates, when God would have us part with them; hee would have us ſeek to bee juſtified by our good works, hee would have us imploy our underſtandings and other abilities of minde and body for other ends, than God hath appointed, and when it is thus, hee muſt bee denied. Therefore its more proper to ſay, that Self muſt bee denied <hi>in,</hi> or
<hi>about</hi> riches, and honours, and good duties; that that riches, and honours, and good duties muſt bee denied, as I ſhall ſhew afterwards.</p>

               <p>Firſt, There is an Argumentative De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of Self, a denial in a way of argumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and reaſoning with Self. There is a twofold reaſoning with ſelf, a reaſoning of conſultation, and a reaſoning of conteſtation.</p>
               <p n="1">1 A reaſoning of conſultation. This is the moſt ordinary and uſual kinde of reaſoning, but moſt abominable, ſeeing Self-conſultors take counſel, but not of God, idolizing the wiſdome of the fleſh within themſelves, which yet<note n="m" place="margin">Rom.
8.7.</note> is enmity againſt God, as the grand Oracle, to which they recourſe continually as able to give advice and direction upon all emergencies; wherefore they retire themſelves into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſummoning in all their thoughts to a privy councel, not at all attending to the counſel of the Word without them, nor to the ſecret hints of the Spirit of God within them, both which they lay aſide as diſſenting in their votes. Even as <hi>Ahab</hi> when he was to adviſe about his war with the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> would not ſend for <hi>Michaiah,</hi> becauſe ſaid hee,<note n="n" place="margin">1 King. 22.8</note> hee doth not propheſie good concerning mee, — <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170316:37"/>as hee in <hi>Homer</hi> on the like occaſion. There are not two greater enemies in the world than Self, and Chriſt, and their counſels are mutually deſtructive one of the other, therefore Self will not adviſe with Chriſt in any thing. <hi>The natural man, i.e.</hi> the Selfiſh man, <hi>is not, nor indeed</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 8.7.</note>
                  <hi>can bee ſubject unto Chriſt;</hi> hee's <hi>now</hi> a ſecret enemy, then an open and profeſſed rebel, <hi>alwayes</hi> an actor in a way of oppoſition againſt him, ſtriving with him for his Crown, and ſcrambling with him for his Scepter. This deſigne of prevailing againſt Chriſt, Self carries on by advice, and counſel from carnal reaſon, which ſtill adviſeth the breaking of his bonds, and the caſting away all thoſe cords that are any way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory to his ſervice. Counſel in a ſelfiſh heart, is the firſt and great engine that moves all the leſſer wheels of oppoſition againſt Jeſus Chriſt, the womb that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, and the breaſt that ſuckles all thoſe devilliſh plots and contrivances whereby it keeps up its own kingdome, and labours to ruine Chriſts; for <hi>fruſtra ſunt arma fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A notable inſtance we have of this in the ſecond Pſalme, <hi>The Kings of the eearth ſet themſelves, and the Rulers took counſel together againſt the Lord.</hi> Now mark what was the reſult of this debate the iſſue of this conſultation, <hi>Let us break</hi> (ſay they)
<hi>his bonds, and caſt his cords
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170316:37"/>from us.</hi> This is the counſel that Selfe gives whenſoever it is conſulted with.</p>
               <p n="1">1 If it bee a bond of injunction, a cord of duty, Self preſently gives counſel for the breaking of it: A Selfiſh man is an Heifer unaccuſtomed to the yoak, and therefore no wonder that hee draws back, when Chriſt would draw him forward. It is the nature of Self, to work for it ſelf, and not for another. Beſides, the ſervice of Chriſt is of a ſpiritual nature, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly imployments ſuit not with one that is carnal.</p>
               <p>And further, the duties of the Goſpel are attended with the contradiction of ſinners, the ſhame and the croſs accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them, and therefore Self cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure them. But conſcience which in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of its power and authority, is Gods Vicegerent in the ſoul, will not ſuffer him to be quiet, but calls for duty, lifting up its voyce, and crying aloud, <hi>Duty, Duty, man, it is thy duty,</hi> and it will have <hi>the full tale alſo.</hi> Therefore that hee may quietly omit the duty, conſcience muſt bee ſilenced. But how muſt this bee? Why Self preſcribes a way preſently.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Let conſcience bee <hi>blinded,</hi> that it may <hi>not ſee it to be a duty.</hi> If this cannot bee done, then,</p>
               <p n="2">2 Let conſcience bee <hi>bribed,</hi> that it may not ſay, <hi>It is a duty.</hi> If this will not do, then,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:170316:38"/>3 Let conſcience bee <hi>broken,</hi> and this will bee ſure to do it. Thus do many men when they have convictions upon their ſpirits, they labour either to extinguiſh the light, or elſe to get it on the ſame ſide with their luſts; but if they can doe neither, as many times they cannot, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they live under a convincing Miniſtery, then they reſolve to ſin againſt their light; as for ſuch and ſuch duties they are not conſiſtent with their carnal intereſs, therefore come what will of it, they cannot, they will not ſubmit unto them. Thus what ever bee in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, they are reſolved this ſhall bee the concluſion, <hi>We will not have this man to reigne over us,</hi> Luke 19.14.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If it bee a bond of prohibition, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining bond, ſelf adminiſters counſel for the breaking of this too. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement that comes to a ſelfiſh man, forbidding him to proceed any further in the purſuit of his carnal projects for the ſatisfaction of his luſts, now when the commandement comes, Self comes too for the making void of this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Tis
<hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.9. <hi>When the Commandement came, ſin revived.</hi> Then the Commandement comes, when tis underſtood by conſcience, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience dares not but ſpeak unto the ſoul what it underſtands, whether it bee a duty or a ſin. Now when the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170316:38"/>comes in this manner unto Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, declaring the ſin, and threatning the vengeance that will follow it; Self is preſently alarum'd, and in all haſte calls a Counſel for the breaking of this bond. It cannot endure that its licentiouſneſs ſhould be reſtrained, and therefore deals with Conſcience here as before, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to widen and wire-draw the Conſcience, to delude and cheat it, and if this cannot be affected, it reſolves to do violence to it. <hi>Balaam,</hi> when he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced what a dangerous ſin it was to curſe the people of God, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, for the Gold and Silver, and great promotion that was offered him, he had a great mind to do; preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to conſult, to ſee if there were any way in the World to make it lawful. And thus do many, when the thoughts of ſinne do lye in the way to any thing they have a minde to, they <hi>try if it may be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,</hi> they will ſee if they can bring down Gods mind to theirs, becauſe they are loath to bring up their minds to Gods, that ſo God may deny himſelf becauſe they will not. The Apoſtle<note n="p" place="margin">Epheſ. 5.10</note> exhorts us, to <hi>prove what is the good and acceptable will of God,</hi> for this end that we may obey it; but ſelfiſh men prove <hi>what is not the will of God,</hi> becauſe they have no minde to obey it, and therefore are glad if they can finde it to be no duty, becauſe they liſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170316:39"/>not to practice it; and no ſin, becauſe they are loath to bee reſtrained from it. Thus we ſee what courſe men take when they reaſon with Self in a way of conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and therefore this is not that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning whereby Self is denied, this is ſo farre from Self-denial, that it is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieſt ſelf-pleaſing, and ſelf-ſeeking that is in the world. Self muſt not bee conſulted withall when we are called to come after Chriſt.
<hi>Abraham</hi> when he was called to go out into a place which hee ſhould after receive for an Inheritance, <hi>obeyed, and went out, not knowing whither he went,</hi> Heb. 11.8. When once wee are certain of the command, 'tis too late to ask counſel. <hi>In retam ſancta non eſt deliberandum.</hi> Let us then go on to the ſecond particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2 A reaſoning of conteſtation, this is the reaſoning here meant; we muſt not reaſon with Self in a way of conſultation, but in a way of conteſtation. This is a principal part of Self-denial, for the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof conſider theſe two particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Self will affirm that which is not to be affirmed, both of ſins and duties, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things; it will<note n="q" place="margin">Eſa. 5.20</note> call darkneſs light, and light darkneſs; it will call that which is evil, good, and that which is good, evil; it will put bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter. Firſt, it will call darkneſs light, it will ſay of the groſſeſt
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170316:39"/>errour, it is the moſt glorious truth; thus it calls Antinomianiſme a Honey-combe, Familiſm the rule of perfection, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minianiſme Gods love to Mankind. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it will call light darkneſs, it will ſay of the moſt glorious Truths, they are but the dreams, and melancholly fancies of a company of ignorant and ſilly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Thus it decries the holy Scriptures as a dead Letter, a beggerly Element, incky Divinity, and a Humane invention. Thirdly, it will call that which is evil good, it will commend the fouleſt Vices, for the faireſt vertues; thus it calls Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs good fellowſhip, Covetouſneſs frugality, and Pride magnanimity. Fourthly, it will call that which is good evil; thus it calls Preciſeneſs hipocriſic, and Zeal vain glory. Fifthly, it will put bitter for ſweet; thus it ſays of Religion, that it is but a melancholly dumpiſh thing, voyd of all true pleaſure and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. Laſtly, ſweet for bitter, and thus it ſays, that the only way to peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort is, to make conſcience of nothing. Thus Self ſpeaks many times in <hi>bare af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations</hi> only, without arguing of the caſe, or urging what it ſays by the ſtrength of ſeeming reaſon; And this is from hence, that in Natural men, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through ignorance, but alſo many times through a wilful and inordinate love of that which is evil, and inveterate
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170316:40"/>hatred of that which is good; this unjuſt ſentencing of truth and falſehood, and good and evil, is not ſo much as called in queſtion, ſo that it being taken for granted what Self ſays, there needs no further urging of it. But now, if that an <hi>Ipſe dixit,</hi> a bare affirmation will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, there being ſome conviction or other in the Conſcience that gain ſays it; then,</p>
               <p n="2">2 Self will endeavour to prove what it ſayes by ſtrength of argument; it will not only ſay of evil that it is good, and of good that it is evil, but it will alledge ſuch and ſuch Reaſons why it muſt needs bee ſo, and theſe Reaſons it will urge with much vehemency and importunity, preſſing them not only upon the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the gaining of the affections, but upon the affections alſo for the winning of the judgement, and by this means it ſo farre prevails with many, that the moſt powerful and convincing preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will not work upon them.</p>
               <p>Our duty in this caſe is Two-fold, 1. To diſtinguiſh. 2. To deny.</p>
               <p n="1">1 To diſtinguiſh ſeeming reaſon from that which is reaſon indeed. Self pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth its ſtrong reaſons, as they are called, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.21. but their chiefeſt ſtrength is the colour and vizard of true Reaſon wherewith they are diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſtrip them of their cloathing, and they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170316:40"/>diſ-appear preſently; they ſeem to bee reaſon, but indeed are not: Like as in a picture of fire, wipe off the colours and nothing remains. In all the Arguments that Self brings, two things are warily to be obſerved; Firſt, what it lays down for a principle, or rule; and, Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how it doth apply it. The fallacie lyes in one of theſe two, and where the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy is, wee muſt be ſure to deny.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Sometimes the fallacy or deceit lies in the principle; Self hath many wicked and curſed Principles, whereby it miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leads the generality of the world. As,

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 Sometimes the fallacy is in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Principle, as for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; ſometimes Self pleads for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, under the name of Liberality; for Covetouſneſs, under the name of Frugality; for fooliſh Pitty, under the name of Lenity and Mercy; for Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, under the name of Devotion; for Cenſoriouſneſs, under pretence of Zeal; and laſtly, for Licentiouſneſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Chriſtian liberty. Here the principle is good, but the application naught. As ſuppoſe when a man is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe in his expences, waſting his eſtate in unneceſſary entertainments, &amp;c. if the queſtion be put, whether he do vertuouſly or not? Self will tell him hee does vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly; and to prove it, frames this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Hee that ſpends liberally does vertuouſly; but thou ſpendeſt liberally,
<hi>Ergo.</hi> Here the Principle is good, for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality is a vertue, and he that is liberal deviſeth liberal things. But the teſtimony or application is falſe, for in ſpending in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170316:41"/>that manner hee is prodigal. Now when we have found out wherein the fallacy lies, whether in the principle or teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, we muſt have a care,</p>
               <p n="2">2 To give a peremptory denial. And though we ſhould not be able to unriddle all the myſterious fallacies of Carnal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet we muſt by no means yeeld our aſſent to any thing that is brought againſt the Truth; though I cannot diſpute for the Truth, yet I can burn for the Truth, ſaid that worthy Martyr in Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> days. But we ſhall be the better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled with more confidence and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give a denial to all thoſe Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that Self ſhall at any time make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth, the more careful wee bee in acquainting our ſelves with the Principles of the Goſpel, and the more ſerious we be in charging them home up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our own Conſciences. This indeed would be an effectual way of reaſoning down Self, when a man can ſet himſelf in the preſence of God ſeriouſly, ſeeking after his minde and will revealed in his Word, and then bring all theſe Carnal principles of Self unto the Teſt, and upon the diſcovery of their diſagreement with the Principles of the Goſpel, diſcard them, and charge it upon his Conſcience to beleeve the other, and walk by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
'Tis not the knowledge of Goſpel-Principles that is ſufficient to beat down
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170316:42"/>Self, but there muſt bee a charging them upon my Conſcience, I muſt make them my principles; ſuch and ſuch principles I walked by formerly, I but now I have found out better, and theſe henceforth ſhall bee my principles, I will walk by theſe. <hi>So</hi> that when ſelf urgeth Carnal Principles, and Carnal Rules upon me, I muſt anſwer Self, thoſe are not my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, I have now another rule to walk by; thoſe are deſtructive principles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to the purity and peace of my Conſcience, I will not walk by them. Thus of this firſt kind of Self-denial, by way of argumentation and reaſoning.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is another kinde of Self-denyal, and that is a judicial denyal, ſuch a denyal as that of a Judge upon the bench, when hee refuſeth to ſhew mercy to the convicted malefactor. Self muſt not only bee arraigned, and convicted, but alſo ſentenced, and condemned: Sentence of death muſt bee pronounced upon Self. Before Self was an Advocate, and pleaded its own cauſe, now it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Solicitour, and petitions for its life. And thus it will do when it cannot prevail with all its ſubtilties, and carnal reaſonings, but is foiled at its own wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, it will become an humble ſuitor, it will come with tears in its eyes. Now it dares not enter the liſts of diſputation as before, there is ſo much convincing
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170316:42"/>light in the Conſcience, but it goes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way to work, it preſents it ſelf as an object of pitty; it ſpeaks the ſoul fair, and flatters with it, leſt it ſhould bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Self in this caſe will bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to loſe much, it will bee content to loſe the name of Reaſon, and Wiſdome, ſo that it may live. And here many car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hearts are <hi>at a ſtand;</hi> they have ſo much light as ſtops the mouth of Self, itdares not argue and reaſon the caſe; they know it is guilty, but yet they will not paſſe the fatal ſentence upon it. They are afraid to condemn it, for if they ſhould do that, it would bee very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to recal the ſentence, and far more difficult to comply with Self afterwards; it would breed far more guilt and horror in the Conſcience, it being a great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſin to do that for which a man is already ſelf-condemned. But it is not enough to reaſon down Self; wee muſt bring the matter in debate <hi>to a Judgement,</hi> after wee have debated throughly, and heard what Self can ſay for it ſelf: wee muſt come to ſome reſolution, what to do with Self, wee muſt debate it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. In <hi>Acts</hi> 3.13, 14. it is ſaid that the Jewes denyed Chriſt; now turn to the 19th. of <hi>Joh. v.</hi> 15. and wee ſhall ſee how they did it, <hi>They cryed out, away with him, away with him, crucifie him.</hi> Even ſo muſt wee deny Self, when it begs for its life,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170316:43"/>ſaying, away with it, away with it, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it. Many know that God hath decreed the deſtruction of Self, and yet are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid leſt the decree ſhould bring forth too ſoon; yea, they will pray for the killing of their luſts, even while they are loath that God ſhould hear their prayers. As <hi>Auguſtine</hi> confeſſeth of himſelf,<note n="r" place="margin">Confeſſ. l. 8. c. 7. Sect. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>etiam pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieram à te caſtitatem, &amp; dixeram: Da mihi caſtitatem, &amp; continentiam, ſed noli modo. Timebam enim ne me cito exaudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, &amp; cito ſanares à morbo concupiſcentiae, quem malebam expleri quam extingui.</hi> I deſired (ſaith hee) in the beginning of my youth, that thou wouldſt give mee chaſtity, and I ſaid, <hi>give mee O Lord cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity,</hi> and continency, <hi>but not yet,</hi> for I was afraid leſt thou ſhouldeſt have heard mee too ſoon, and healed my diſeaſe too ſoon, which I had rather have had ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, than extinguiſhed. What do they ſpeak but that the work of converſion is yet very doubtful? to ſay no more. There is an hoſtile Self-denyal. This is the actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al execution of Self. Self muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee convicted, and condemned, but actually crucified, and throughly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified. Self is not to live in the ſoul, it hath lain under the curſe ever ſince its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from God; and this curſe will eat out its very life in all that belong to God. This wee muſt ſubmit unto if ever wee mean to bee Chriſtians indeed, wee muſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170316:43"/>bee content to let Chriſt do whatſoever hee pleaſeth within us, hee muſt have his will of us, hee muſt bee ſuffered to ſay where, and what hee will. If wee will bee Saints, wee muſt have fellowſhip with him in his death, as well as in his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; wee muſt bee crucified, as hee was crucified, that the body of ſin may bee deſtroyed, and herein wee are not to bee paſſive only, but active too, <hi>wee muſt by the Spirit mortifie the deeds of the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.13. This implies a twofold act of Self-denyal.</p>
               <p n="1">1. An act of retention, or with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Self thoſe things that keep it alive.
<hi>Two things have I required of thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Agur,</hi> Prov. 30.7. <hi>deny mee them not, or with-hold them not from mee befor I dye.</hi> So 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.27. <hi>Hee ſent unto mee for my ſilver, and my gold, and I deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not.</hi> Heb. I kept not back from him. This then is to deny Self, to with-hold, and keep back from it thoſe things it would have. Wee muſt not fulfill the luſts of Self. So the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>ult. make not proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof.</hi> And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wee may very well bee ſparing unto Self, it hath uſurped much, but nothing is its due. Self is an helliſh vorage that ſtill cryes, give, give, a bottomeleſſe gulf that ſucks in all before it. Where it lives and reignes, it makes every thing
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170316:44"/>become tributary, it Lords it over time, and ſtrength, and parts; it exacts homage and devoir from every thing. Therefore Self muſt bee ſtinted, it muſt bee cut ſhort of its allowance. There is no need of feeding Self, it will grow faſt enough of its own accord. Nature affords it live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood enough whereſoever it is; ſo that adventitious helps are altogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe. As it is with the ground which is curſed for mans ſake, it brings forth naturally Briars, and Thorns, without manuring, without tilling, So it is with mans heart, it is altogether diſpoſed, and of it ſelf apt, too too apt to engender, and bring forth all manner of noiſome luſts, which being fed, multiply in more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Notwithſtanding it bee thus, yet many there are, yea, multitudes that pretend to come after Chriſt, who yet are too indulgent to themſelves, laviſhing out upon themſelves whatſoever their luſts call for. Theſe are perſons of ſuch facile and eaſy nature, that they can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny themſelves any thing, they muſt have not only for neceſſity, but luſt alſo. Pride calls for this, and th'other faſhion, they muſt have it preſently; Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, and they are ſick if they have it not; Ambition for <hi>Mordecaies</hi> Cap and Knee, and they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not injoy themſelves if they have it not. But my Brethren, do you think that ever
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170316:44"/>this fire of Self-love will bee extinguiſhed while yee daily adminiſter fewel unto it? do you think that ever this Prodigal will return to his Fathers houſe, while hee hath mony and maintenance at his will and pleaſure? Self muſt bee ſtinted, not fed and pampered, that is the firſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Anact of ſubſtraction. This is another act of mortifying Self-denyal. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is properly a negation, this latter a privation. Self catcheth at every thing, it continually gathers in unto it ſelf, but never lets any thing go, unleſſe upon double or treble intereſſe. It is a cruel ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortioner, a griping uſurer. It never parts with any thing, but upon main force, and therefore violence muſt bee uſed in taking from it. Self acts many times violently, and by force for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of its luſts, and violence muſt bee oppoſed to this ſelfiſh violence. Self gains by force, and it muſt loſe by force alſo. Self doth violence to principles of Reaſon, and Revelation, it with-holds the truth in unrighteouſneſſe, it breaks all bonds, that ſo it may act without controule, and this licentiouſneſſe gotten by force, it will keep by force, unleſſe a greater force prevail againſt it. This is that ſtrong man, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.29. that keeps the houſe untill a ſtronger than hee break in by violence upon him, and caſt him
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170316:45"/>out. Thoſe that will come after Chriſt muſt do as Chriſt did, who
<hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Spoiled Principalities, and Powers.</hi> Chriſt ſpoiled principalities, and powers, <hi>for us, and without us,</hi> but there are other princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and powers, which hee ſpoileth <hi>within us, and by us,</hi> and theſe are the principalities and powers of carnal Self, in the deſtroying of theſe wee muſt bee copartners with Chriſt, when the
<hi>Iſr ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> were called out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to come after <hi>Moſes</hi> into the promiſed Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> (being therein a type of the Saints going after Chriſt to Heaven) it is ſaid, <hi>they Spoiled the Aegyptians,</hi> Exod. 12.36. under whom they had been ſo long held in bondage. The grand Tyrant under which all natural men lye to this very day, is Self. Self is hee that refuſeth to let the people of God go at the call of the Goſpel; but friends, whenſoever yee will ſer forward in obedience to the call of Chriſt, to come after him; you muſt bee ſure to ſpoil theſe eruel principalities and powers of Self within you, they have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped a long time many precious Jewels, of parts, and abilities, and affections, for their own ſervice, but all theſe muſt bee taken from them by violence, they are fitter for the ſervice of Chriſt, than of Self; therefore not an hoof muſt bee left behinde, not ſo much as a thought for the ſervice of Self. Ah ſouls! think on it ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170316:45"/>what a loſer God hath been, and what loſers you your ſelves have been, ſince Self hath had the upperhand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you! how little have you done for the bleſſed God of heaven, and earth, ſince you have been in the world! how little you have done for your precious ſouls! Self hath as it were bought you out of the hands of God, and you are become its bond-ſlaves. Wee read of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
                  <note n="s" place="margin">1 King. 21.20.</note> 
                  <hi>that hee ſold himſelf to work evil.</hi> Thus have you done, who are for the preſent under the power of Self, you are appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices unto Self, work <hi>from</hi> Self, and <hi>for</hi> Self, receive all your direction, all your incouragement from Self; if Self bid you go, you go, if Self ſay come, you come, you go at its bidding, and come at its beck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the reaſon is, Self is your Lord and Maſter: Now before you can come after Chriſt, you muſt bee recovered out of the hands of Self; God hath loſt, and you have loſt, and therefore by violence you muſt ſnatch away whatſoever Self hath gotten, either from God, or from your own ſouls. Self hath had poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion long enough, for ſhame let him not dwell quietly any longer. Self hath reigned a long time, and too long, it is time now that hee be dethroned, and that the Lord Jeſus bee exalted in his room. Stollen waters have been ſweet to Self, and bread eaten in ſecret, very pleaſant;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170316:46"/>Oh! it is now time to imbitter them. What one of the Fathers ſayes of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I may ſay of Self-denyal; it is <hi>ſordium vomitus,</hi> Self-denyal is a purging grace; a cleanſing grace, it forceth up all its ſweet morſels again. Thus wee ſee what muſt bee done, if wee mean that Self ſhould bee deſtroyed. Wee muſt not only not give to Self, but wee muſt alſo take away from Self, whatſoever hath been unjuſtly detained by it. Hath Self any right to what it keeps back from Jeſus Chriſt? certainly not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will ſay to all that read this book, as the Prophet to the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 21.26.
<hi>Remove the Diadem, take off the Crown, exalt him that is low,</hi> lift up Chriſt upon the Throne, who is now trampled under foot by Self, <hi>abaſe him that is high,</hi> bring down ſelf into the duſt, if yee will not, then as in the 27th. <hi>verſ. God will overturn, overturn, overturn, and it ſhall bee no more, untill hee come, whoſe right it is, and hee will give it him.</hi>

<hi>Luther</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it no ſmall error in <hi>Melancthon,</hi> that to the intent that all might bee aſcribed unto God; hee imagined Chriſt to bee further off from his heart, than indeed hee was. <hi>Solt Deo omnia deberi tam ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinatè aſſerit, ut mihi planè videatur ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem in hoc errare, quod Chriſtum ipſe fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, longius abeſſe cordt ſuo, quàm ſit reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>râ;</hi> But ſaith hee, <hi>Certè nimis nullus in hoc eſt Philippus;</hi> Certainly <hi>Philip</hi> is <hi>too-much-nothing</hi> in this kinde of Self-denyal. It is not humility, but pride, and foul in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, not to acknowledge what good ſoever God hath wrought in us; which is not ſo well taken notice of as it ſhould by ſome, otherwiſe very good men, and women, who now and then will needs
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170316:47"/>thus ſeverely paſſe ſentence upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as having not one jot of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in them. It is commonly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ſuch as have to do with men of troubled conſciences, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they will acknowledge ſuch things to bee in themſelves, as according to the judgement of the word, are the very fruits, and real effects of Gods ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit, yet by no means will they yeeld, that there is a work of grace in their hearts. They cannot deny but that there is a change in ſome meaſure wrought from what they were before; the wayes of God which once they count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too ſtrict and preciſe, and hated under that very notion; they now love, and account them the happieſt ſouls that walk in them; and thoſe ſinful wayes which they took pleaſure in formerly, they now loath, and deteſt, and are even aſhamed of them; and as for the people of God whom in times paſt they hated, and perſecuted, they now love them dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and eſteem them the only excellent ones upon the earth. They cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but they have an hungring and thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the Lord Jeſus; not only to bee made partakers of his Righteouſneſſe, but his Holineſſe alſo, and that nothing without this, will content, and ſatisfie them; and yet notwithſtanding all this, they will moſt unreaſonably conclude
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170316:47"/>againſt themſelves that they have no grace; and for what reaſon? why, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not ſuch a meaſure of grace as they apprehend to bee in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; they have not ſuch ſtirring and ſtrong affections, ſuch a meaſure of grief for ſin, ſuch a meaſure of love to, and delight in the wayes of godlineſſe, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have, and hence they conclude they have nothing in themſelves more than what may bee found in reprobates, and that all is but in Hypocriſy. Now, could they but ſee it, there is much of Self in this, that becauſe they <hi>have not ſo much as they would,</hi> they will not <hi>take notice of ſo much as they have.</hi> A little grace muſt bee owned, though in the midſt of many corruptions. As with one eye we ſhould look upon the evil that is in our ſelves to bee humbled, ſo with the other we ſhould look upon the good that is in our ſelves to bee thankful. <hi>I am black, but comely,</hi> ſaith the Spouſe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.5.

                     </gap>, it is alwayes neceſſarily in it, and it can no more bee conceived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, than a body without quantity, or fire without heat. To ſay therefore that grace is not a powerful inabling thing, is a very contradiction, for it is all one as to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170316:48"/>ſay that grace is not grace; as to ſay that fire is not hot, is all one as to ſay that fire is not fire. Therefore it is but an idle plea for any one that is godly, to ſay, <hi>hee can do nothing,</hi> and that upon this account hee muſt not attempt the performance of any good duty, <hi>till the Spirit move him.</hi> Verily there is much of Self in this. <hi>Non poſſe praetenditur, non velle in cauſâ eſt.</hi> Want of power is pretended, but want of will is the cauſe why thoſe that are godly do no more than they do. I doubt not to affirm that ordinarily it is ſo. <hi>Auſtin</hi> wondring at himſelf (as hee tells us, <hi>L.</hi> 8. <hi>Confeſſ. c</hi> 9.) why the minde when it commands the body, ſhould preſently bee obeyed, but when it commands it ſelf, ſhould bee refiſted, thus at length reſolves the caſe. <hi>Non ex toto vult, non ergo ex to-to imperat,</hi> it doth not fully will, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth not fully command. <hi>Nam in tantum imperat in quantum vult, &amp; in tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum non fit quod imperat, in quantum non vult;</hi> for in ſo much it doth command, in as much as it doth will, and in ſo much that is not done that it doth command, in as much as it doth not will. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts <hi>Timothy to ſtir up the gift of God which was in him,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.6. and hee gives this reaſon, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7 <hi>for God hath given us the Spirit of Power, of Love, and of a ſound minde.</hi> And the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.7.

<hi>Non totus aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgit,</hi> ſaith hee, it doth not fully riſe up. Therefore though
<hi>Natural</hi> men, who are dead in ſin, <hi>bee without ſtrength,</hi> and ſo cannot ſtir up themſelves to a further do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and receiving of that which is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually good, yet

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170316:49"/>Uncleanneſſe, Laſciviouſneſſe, Hatred, Variance, Emulation, Strife, Sedition, He reſies, Envyings, Drunkenneſſe, Revellings, and ſuch like.</hi> Yet they go on ſecurely, vainly truſting that none of theſe (ſome whereof they rather judge to bee fruits of the Spirit, than of the fleſh, and others of them (upon the fore-mentioned ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition) rather infirmities, than reigning ſins) ſhall ſeparate them from the love and favour of God, ſeeing, <hi>whomſoever hee loves, hee loves unto the end.</hi> Wee have a remarkable place for this, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48.2. <hi>They call themſelves the holy City, and ſtay themſelves upon the God of</hi> Iſrael, and yet as the former verſe ſhews, they were moſt abominable Hypocrites, they made mention of the God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but not in truth, nor in righteouſneſs; and the fourth verſe tells us, that they were very obſtinate, <hi>their neck was as an Iron ſinew, and their brow braſs.</hi> I am verily perſwaded this is a deluſion that damns millions of ſouls under the Goſpel. Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> in his Treatiſe of
<hi>Justifying Faith,</hi> hath ſo fully opened it, that I thought good for the conviction of this ſort of men, to tranſcribe this that follows.
<q> The Hypocrite (ſaith hee) alwayes pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the practical, as the Heretick doth the theorical rules of Scripture, never ſounds the main depth of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, but paſſeth over it, as if it were
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170316:50"/>ſome Philoſophical ſhallow — And after hee hath once loſt the right way, and wandered a while in <hi>uncertain blinde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of his private favour with God,</hi> takes a courſe quite contrary to all godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. For where our Saviour laies it down as one of the firſt and moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary rudiments of Chriſtianity, that wee muſt forſake all, and deny our ſelves, otherwiſe wee cannot truly follow him, the Hypocrite perſwades himſelf hee hath forſaken Father, and Mother, Siſter and Brother, even all hee hath any ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reference unto, becauſe hee ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly follows Chriſt. As in what? in hearing Sermons, quoting places of Scripture upon every occaſion, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon talk, or in preciſe obſervance of ſome precepts, whoſe practiſe is very <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with his principal deſires, apt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his reputation, otherwiſe defective and lame,</hi> or perhaps conſort as well with his <hi>ſowre afections,</hi> his <hi>niggardly,</hi> or
<hi>ſcrapin diſpoſition,</hi> zeal in reading, and hearing Gods word; I ever admire, where it is accompanied with practice conformable; but to bee more preciſe in <hi>perſwaſions,</hi> than in <hi>actions,</hi> more zealous in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of duties towards God, <hi>no way chargeable,</hi> than <hi>lowly, courteous,</hi> and <hi>real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loving toward their neighbours,</hi> is a fearful ſign that worldly affection hath got the ſtart of Faith in the
<hi>Spring,</hi> and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170316:50"/>will hardly bee overtopped in the <hi>growth;</hi> and that the mind thus affected, is ſickly, and faint, yet willing to <hi>ſtay the working of couſcience</hi> with theſe repaſts. And were it not the nature of this diſeaſe, to <hi>put out the eye of reaſon,</hi> and rely wholly upon <hi>forced perſwaſions;</hi> it were impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſuch palpable contradictions betwixt moſt mens <hi>ordinary reſolutions,</hi> and <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principles of Faith</hi> (as any Heathen that could but underſtand what the words of Scripture meant, would upon the firſt view of both, clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cry) ſhould go ſo long, oft times for ought wee can perceive, the whole courſe of their lives, without controule, or check, and without notice of their danger. Hee is in worſe caſe queſtionleſſe than the meer natural, or reaſonable man, even blinded by Gods juſt Judgement for his hypocriſy, that can ſuffer himſelf to bee perſwaded hee hath truly denyed himſelf, taken up his croſſe, forſaken all, and made fit to follow Chriſt; when as the world ſees, and his practice proclaims hee mindes nothing, either ſo intenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or continually, <hi>as the increaſing of his wealth, or raiſing his own, or his Childrens fortunes, already greater than they are, Chriſtianly capable of.</hi>
                     </q> Thus far the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; Therefore I do here in the name of God warn all thoſe, of what rank ſoever they bee, that ſhall read this Book, that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170316:51"/>as they love the ſalvation of their own ſouls, and would not ſuffer the vengeance of eternal fire with unbeleevers and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, the Devil and his Angels in Hell, they would beware how they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain any ſuch conceit of the goodneſſe of their ſpiritual condition, while in the mean time they neglect to look after the evidence of the <hi>real preſence</hi> of ſin-ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſin-mortifying grace in their own hearts. The five fooliſh Virgins never doubted of their grace, till it was too late, and this was their folly; they were ſhut out of the Bride-chamber for their neglect, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.11, 12. Our Saviour tells us, <hi>that many at the laſt day will ſay unto him, Lord, Lord, have wee not propheſied in thy name?</hi> preached many powerful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, even to the wonder and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe that heard us? <hi>and in thy name caſt out Devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works?</hi> been inſtruments of a wonderful reformation in the places where wee dwelt, caſting out Drunkards, Swearers. Prophaners of the Lords day, &amp;c. and that then
<hi>he will profe ſſe unto them, that he nevr knew them,</hi> Mat. 7.22, 23. <hi>Let every one therefore examine himſelf whether he be in the Faith;</hi> 2 Cor. 13.5 <hi>and give all diligence to make his calling and election ſure, i. e</hi> his election by his calling, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. It is not to deny the expreſſion of it, when it ſhould bee ſeen. Though grace
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170316:51"/>bee an inviſible thing in it ſelf, yet by an holy practice it may bee made viſible. <hi>I willſhew thee my Faith by my works,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi>
2.18. and this is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the commandement of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine forth, that men may ſee your good works, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Some are affraid to <hi>diſcover their graces,</hi> when they doubt it will bee to the prejudice of their worldly intereſſe; and therefore leſt they ſhould offend ſome particular perſons, not cordially affected to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, upon whom they depend for ſome place of honour, or profit, which either they expect for time to come, or for the preſent do injoy, they chuſe rather in a way of baſe ſervile compliance, <hi>to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their corruptions.</hi> But this is a great diſhonour to God, and that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes him exceedingly. It was a great evil in <hi>David,</hi> that hee would play the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural fool</hi> before
<hi>Achiſh,</hi> 1 Sam. 21.13. but certainly it is a far greater evil for any one to play the
<hi>profane fool.</hi> Let ſuch remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that terrible ſpeech of our Saviour, <hi>Mark</hi>
8.38. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall bee aſhamed of mee, and of my words, in this adulterous and ſinful generation, of him alſo ſhall the ſon of man bee aſhamed, when hee commeth in the glory of his Father, with the holy Angels.</hi>

                  <p>Hence many perſons having their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſometimes extraordinarily ſtirred by ſome rowſing Sermon, upon this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary conceit of their own ability to be good, preſently begin to reform their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courſe of life, not only abandoning

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170316:61"/>of perfect and perpetual <hi>conformity</hi> to the Law (both habitual and actual) for time to come; God will have the <hi>Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> fulfilled, as well as the
<hi>Precept</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and the Precept obſerved, as well as the Threatning fulfilled. This the Juſtice of God requires, and therefore, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſuffering</hi> according to the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>alone,</hi> nor being <hi>conformable</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Precept
<hi>alone,</hi> but <hi>both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> that ſatisfies Gods Juſtice; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inherent righteouſneſs <hi>alone</hi> cannot juſtifie, becauſe the Curſe of the Law for ſin, remaines ſtill to be ſuffered. This God ſtands upon, to have ſin puniſhed to the full, according as he hath threatned, and therefore the puniſhment muſt bee endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red either by the Sinner himſelf, or by another (for him, and in his ſtead) that is able to bear it, that ſo God may bee <hi>ſufficiently revenged</hi> for all the wrong that ſin hath done unto him; therefore they doe miſerably miſtake that talk of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, either by habitual or actual righteouſneſs alone, for that is not <hi>full ſatisfaction</hi> to the Juſtice of God, and that which is not <hi>full ſatisfaction,</hi> in this caſe, is no ſatisfaction at all, and where there is no ſatisfaction to the Juſtice of God, there can be no Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe a man ſhould attain to that perfect and compleat habitual conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Law which is required (for of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170316:61"/>that onely wee ſpeak in this place) yet this could not juſtifie him, becauſe it could not acquit him from his ſin in loſing that which hee had before; This
<hi>After-conformity</hi> would not make amends for the former that was loſt: This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<hi>recovered,</hi> is a debt as well as the former which was loſt, and the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one debt, will not ſatisfie for the non payment of another. But that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Law, which is even in the <hi>beſt of Saints,</hi> ſince the <hi>Fall,</hi> is not<note n="z" place="margin">Lex non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum actualem obedientiam ſed &amp; omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modam cum lege conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem requirit, ſecus enim lues originalis pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum non effet. <hi>VVolleb.</hi> l. 1.</note> that perfect and compleat conformity which the Law requires; for wee are renewed but <hi>in part,</hi> there is a remainder of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption ſtill, <hi>A law in our members war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt the law of our minde,</hi> Rom.
7.23. Therefore if wee were to bee tried onely by the <hi>preceptive part</hi> of the Law, wee could not bee juſtified; for ſo long as any thing is lacking of that conformity which the Law requireth, it is impoſſible that the Law ſhould judge us righteous. Therefore there remains nothing but a fearful expectation of a moſt dreadful ſentence of condemnation to bee paſſed upon us, if wee will venture to bee tried for our eternal eſtates by any thing that is in our ſelves. For this reaſon, holy men in Scripture have alwayes renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced their own righteouſneſs, <hi>David</hi> prayes, <hi>Enter not into judgement with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no man living
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170316:62"/>be juſtified,</hi> Pſal. 143.2. <hi>If God will not withdraw his anger</hi> (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) <hi>The proud helpers do ſtoop under him. How much leſs ſhall I anſwer him, and chooſe out my words to reaſon with him, whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not anſwer, but I would make ſupplication to my judge,</hi> Job 9.13, 14, 15. <hi>I know nothing by my ſelfe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>yet am I not hereby juſtified,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.4. And therefore he profeſſeth, <hi>That he accounted all things but dung, that hee might win Chriſt, and be found in him, not having his own righteouſneſs, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Chriſt, the righteouſneſs which is of God by faith,</hi> Philip. 3.8, 9.</p>
                  <p>And indeed every man that ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the <hi>glaſs of the Law,</hi> will ſee a neceſſity of another righteouſneſs than <hi>his own,</hi> every man (I ſay) except the man St. <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Who having beheld himſelf therein, goeth away; and ſtreightwar forgetteth what manner of man hee was,</hi> Jam. 1.24.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of <hi>Denying-ſelf, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Inherent Grace.</hi>

                  <p>WE have ſeen what it is to <hi>deny Self,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Grace,</hi> I ſhall now ſhew what it is, in reſpect of <hi>Gifts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And 1 What it is for thoſe that want Gifts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 What for thoſe that have them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 What it is for thoſe that want Gifts.</p>
                  <p>And here I ſhall ſpeak (as before) both Negatively and Affirmatively.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Negatively, For thoſe that want Gifts, to deny Self in reſpect of Gifts, is not,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 To deny the excellency, uſefulneſs, or neceſſity of them. None are more apt to ſtight and contemn Gifts, than thoſe that are moſt defective in them. And of theſe,
<hi>ſome</hi> do it out of <hi>ignorance,</hi> ſpeaking evil of the things <hi>that they underſtand not,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.12. and Jude verſ. 10. <hi>Others</hi> out of <hi>pride,</hi> being loath to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelves to be <hi>wanting in any thing that is excellent.</hi> Others out of a <hi>blinde devotion</hi> to Grace, as if a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Gifts were ſome way or other <hi>derogatory</hi> from Grace, and theſe think it a matter of Self-denial <hi>not to think
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170316:63"/>well</hi> of any thing <hi>that is not grace.</hi> But as Grace muſt have its due eſteem, ſo muſt Gifts alſo. Gifts are excellent, though not ſo excellent as Grace. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 They are <hi>the purchaſe of Chriſt,</hi> the fruits of his Reſurrection and Aſcention, Epheſ. 4.8. <hi>When hee aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave Gifts to men.</hi> It was the manner of the <hi>Roman Conquerors</hi> in their <hi>Triumphs</hi> to aſcend up to the <hi>Capitol</hi> in a <hi>Chair of State,</hi> with their priſoners following at their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot wheels on foot, having their hands bound behinde them, and as they went along, the <hi>Victor</hi> was wont to throw ſome <hi>Miſſilia,</hi> certain peeces of Coyn, and other rich gifts to be gathered up by the people.</p>
                  <p>Even ſo the Lord Jeſus when hee aſcended <hi>in triumph</hi> up to Heaven, <hi>having ſpoyled Principalities and Powers,</hi> hee made <hi>a ſhew of them openly,</hi> Col. 2.15.
<hi>and gave gifts unto men.</hi> And this ſpeaks the excellency of them. Princes in their
<hi>Triumphs</hi> do not give mean gifts, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Royal gifts,</hi> they do not onely triumph in their Victory, but in their Liberality alſo, which makes their Victory far more glorious.</p>
                  <p>Even ſo the Lord Jeſus, to make his Aſcention more <hi>ſplendid</hi> and glorious hee gave <hi>Gifts</hi> to men, and theſe Gifts have a
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170316:63"/>
                     <hi>Triumphal image and ſuper ſcription</hi> upon them to this day, they being ſo <hi>notably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental</hi> in deſtroying the Kingdome of Sathan and Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The <hi>Operation of the Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.2, 4. <hi>There are diverſity of Gifts, but the ſame Spirit,</hi> that is the Author of them all. This the Apoſtle proveth by
<hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,</hi> verſ. 8, 9, 10. <hi>For to one is given by the ſpirit, the word of wiſdome, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the word of knowledge, by the ſame ſpirit; to another the working of miracles, to another propheſie, to another diſcerning of ſpirits, to another divers kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues. But all theſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>worketh that one and the ſelf-ſame ſpirit, dividing to every one as hee will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence ſuch as have received Gifts, are ſaid to bee <hi>made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Heb. 6.4. And in reſpect of <hi>Gifts,</hi> it is as well as of <hi>Grace,</hi> that the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel is called the <hi>Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.8. and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of the Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.7. And therefore hee that reproacheth Gifts, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Of ſpecial uſe and ſervice in the Church, Eph 4.11, 12. <hi>He gave ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170316:64"/>Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi> Wherefore Gifts are of excellent uſe, and wee cannot ſay, <hi>Wee have no need of them.</hi> Were it not for Gifts, the Church would bee in a ſad condition: How ſhould the Scriptures bee interpreted? How ſhould the mouths of the Adverſaries bee ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, but for Gifts? All are not Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, all are not able to manage an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor anſwer an Objection. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gifts muſt not bee contemned, but highly prized.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It is not to deny the reſpect and honour which ſhould bee given to thoſe that have them. Many perſons miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpreting that of the Pſalmiſt [<hi>In whoſe eyes a vile perſon is contemned,</hi> Pſal. 15.4.] And that of the Apoſtle [<hi>Hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth know wee no man after the fleſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.16.] Think there is no honour to bee given to any for their
<hi>Gifts,</hi> while they give no evidence of their <hi>Graces.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, Wee muſt not give them that honour which belongs unto men, <hi>as they have Grace,</hi> but yet we muſt alſo beware that wee deny them not the honour that is due to men as
<hi>they have Gifts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men may bee <hi>honourable</hi> in reſpect of ſome <hi>good</hi> thing which they
<hi>have,</hi> though
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170316:64"/>
                     <hi>concemptible</hi> in reſpect of ſome <hi>better thing</hi> which they
<hi>want.</hi> Though men have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Gifts, yet they are amiable and honourable for their Gifts ſake. Chriſt loved the young man for the excellency of his moral parts, <hi>Mar.</hi>
10.21. Now if Chriſt loves ſuch, why ſhould not wee? Next unto thoſe that have Grace, come they that have Gifts, though the men bee bad, their Gifts are good, and there is an honour due unto them. The Spirit of God, will bee acknowledged in Gifts, as well as in Grace, ſeeing hee is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of both.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 It is not to deny the labour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry which ought to bee beſtowed in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring of them. <hi>Auſtin</hi> makes mention of ſome that neglected the means of knowledge, becauſe it <hi>pufs up,</hi> and were willingly ignorant that they might bee humble. But this is by flying the <hi>ſhadow,</hi> to imbrace the <hi>body</hi> of ſin. It is not the fault of knowledge, nor of any other gift, that it puffeth up, but of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which takes an occaſion thereby to make us <hi>ſwell.</hi> If through corruption, a man is apt to bee proud of his graces (as Mr.
<hi>Fox</hi> once ſaid of himſelf,
<q>Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I get hurt by my Graces, and ſometimes I get good by my Sins, for by my ſinnes I am made more humble, and by my Graces I am made more proud)</q> Wee need not wonder, if
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170316:65"/>through the ſame, he be apt to grow proud of his gifts.</p>
                  <p>But if this bee no Objection againſt our endeavours for <hi>Grace,</hi> why ſhould it bee pleaded againſt our endeavours for <hi>Gifts?</hi> Wee may not neglect our duty for fear of any evill that may acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally come thereof. It is not onely law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but a duty to deſire and endeavour after gifts, <hi>Covet earneſtly the beſt Gifts,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the
<hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.31.</p>
                  <p>It is the ſtudy of ſome, that they may bee <hi>general Scholars,</hi> that they may bee
<hi>ſome body</hi> in every thing, ſo it ſhould bee in the <hi>School of Chriſt. Whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report, If there bee any vertue, and if there bee any praiſe, wee ſhould think on theſe things,</hi> Phil. 4.8.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtians ſhould ſtrive to excel one another, not onely in Grace, but in Gifts alſo; For though Grace be ſufficient for a mans ſelf, yet not for himſelf <hi>relatively</hi> conſidered. Every member hath a <hi>double office, one</hi> to receive in for himſelf, and
<hi>another</hi> to<note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 4.16.</note> give forth to the reſt. Now Grace inables a man to <hi>receive in,</hi> but Gifts onely to <hi>give forth.</hi> Many have a good treaſure within, but want lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170316:65"/>and other gifts to bring it forth, and therefore have need to pray, that they may interpret the meaning of their own hearts for the edification of others.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Affirmatively, For thoſe that want Gifts to <hi>deny ſelf</hi> in reſpect of Gifts, is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Not to <hi>murmure</hi> at the diſpenſation of God, in giving unto others, that which for the preſent, is denyed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>It is an evil, that ſuch as are defective in any thing wherein others doe excel, are by nature very ſubject to, <hi>To think that God deals unequally with them.</hi> What <hi>hard thoughts of God</hi> have many that are <hi>poor,</hi> becauſe they are not ſo <hi>rich</hi> as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers! and many that are <hi>black,</hi> becauſe they are not ſo <hi>comely</hi> as others! and many that are <hi>diſeaſed,</hi> becauſe they are not ſo <hi>healthy</hi> as others! and many that are in <hi>thraldome,</hi> becauſe they have not the <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi> that others have! What <hi>hard ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches againſt God</hi> doe many of theſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times utter! Curſing the day wherein they were born, and accuſing the influences of the Stars, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus many not diſcerning in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch abilities and perfections of minde, as they diſcover in others, are ever and anon quarrelling at the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of God, as if he had not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170316:66"/>poliſhed his work, as if hee had not done it ſo exactly as he ſhould, wiſhing rather they had never been made, than made ſo imperfect; and ſome mens diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of themſelves has been ſo great, that growing impatient of beholding any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger their own imperfections, they have laid violent hands upon themſelves, and made themſelves inſtruments of that ſmall meaſure of <hi>annihilation</hi> which they are capable of.</p>
                  <p>The ſerious conſideration of the <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſoveraignty</hi> of God over us (we being in his hands as Clay in the hands of the Potter) would ſhew us what an unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable thing it is, for any one (of what <hi>make</hi> ſoever hee bee) to murmur in this manner againſt his
<hi>Maker; Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus?</hi> Rom. 9.20. <hi>Shall the clay ſay to him that faſhioneth it, What makeſt thou? or thy work, Hee hath no hands?</hi> Iſa. 45.9. <hi>Hath not the Potter power over the clay, of the ſame lump to make one veſſel unto honour, and another un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſhonour?</hi> Rom. 9.21. Beſides, wee ſhould conſider what we have juſtly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited by our <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> from God; have we not ſinned away the perfections and accompliſhments of the minde, as well as of the body? if ſo, wee are not wronged, though they never be reſtored. But many times wee <hi>charge God fooliſhly,</hi> when the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170316:66"/>fault is in our ſelves; wee complaine of <hi>Nature,</hi> when wee neglect the <hi>means;</hi> it may bee he hath made us capable of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement as well as others, but wee are ſlothful, and take no paines, wee do not <hi>digge for knowledge as for hid treaſure,</hi> and therefore no wonder wee are without it. But whatever bee the reaſon that wee have not the like gifts with others, there is no reaſon that wee ſhould therefore murmure againſt God. This is a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in any one, but farre greater in one that has grace; to overlook our
<hi>Graces,</hi> becauſe wee have not <hi>gifts,</hi> is worſt of all. If God hath given us the
<hi>better part,</hi> what cauſe have we to complaine? If we have the <hi>gift of grace,</hi> wee need not bee much troubled, that wee have not the <hi>grace of gifts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that hath <hi>Grace,</hi> hath a <hi>gift</hi> worth all the <hi>gifts</hi> in the world; and yet as I have already hinted, there are few or none ſo <hi>deficient,</hi> as to be altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out gifts, at leaſt without a capacity of attaining ſome gift or other, whereby in their places they may bee ſerviceable to the body.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the foot ſhall ſay, Becauſe I am not the hand, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body? and if the ear ſhall ſay, Becauſe I am not the eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body; If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? if the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170316:67"/>whole were hearing, where were the ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?</hi> 1 Corint. 12.15, 16, 17. If all had the ſame gifts, there would follow a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the whole body, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of themſelves too; for it could not be a body, unleſs it were made of many members knit together, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe one from another. But <hi>Self</hi> is not ſo well pleaſed with what it hath, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented at what it wants; and hence comes murmuring and repining againſt God. Here then is Self-denial to ſuppreſs all hard thoughts of this different diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, ſeeing he hath <hi>ſet the members every one of them in the body, as it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him,</hi> and it is fit that wee ſhould ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to his wiſdome, and ſubmit to his will therein.</p>
                  <p>Again, for thoſe that want gifts, <hi>to deny Self in reſpoct of gifts;</hi> is,</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Not to <hi>envie</hi> thoſe that have them. The Spirit that dwelleth in us luſteth to envie, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>James</hi> 4.5. that is, inciteth putteth on, and moveth ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly unto envie. When wee behold any excellency in another, out-ſhining that which is in our ſelves (ſo that, that which before was made glorious, hath now no glory by reaſon of their glory which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels) <hi>Self</hi> preſently bewrayeth it ſelf in this paſſion of envie, urging us with<note n="b" place="margin">Feſtos dies non agit invidia</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant importunity by all manner of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to <hi>maligne</hi> his perſon, and doe
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170316:67"/>what in us lyes to quench the light of his excellency, and turn his glory into ſhame; for this is the nature of envie, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the deſtruction of its object, it being nothing elſe but an<note n="c" place="margin">Eſt triſtitia de bono alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, ut pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium noſtrum bonum impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dire vel mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuere creditur; ideo incitat ut bonum proximi, quantum in nobis eſt, impediamus, &amp; contrarium malum ei procuremus. <hi>Rivet</hi> in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calog.</note>
                     <hi>inward vexation at the good that is in another, for this very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that ſo much glory or praiſe ſeemeth to be taken from us, as is given to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hence we are provoked in our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to doe our uttermoſt to deprive him of it, and to procure the contrary evil unto him, which if it cannot bee effected, then to endeavour the deſtruction of his perſon; as wee may ſee in the Story of <hi>Cain, Joſephs</hi> Brethren,
<hi>Saul,</hi> and the Scribes and Phariſees in their dealing with Chriſt. It is a ſpecial part of Self-denial then in thoſe that want gifts, not to <hi>envie</hi> thoſe that have them.

                  <p>Self-denial is that which herein they do pretend, but the thing which they principally aime at, is the exalting of themſelves, while they would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that God deals more intimately and familiarly with them than with any elſe-beſides.</p>

                  <p>Three things therefore are required of all ſuch as have gifts, in full of this firſt particular of Self-denial, <hi>Not to bee proud of them.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3 Not to hate others, becauſe they doe excell in them. We have all theſe in
<hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3, 4, 5. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking to all thoſe that have gifts, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them not to be proud of them, gives a three-fold reaſon of ſo neceſſary a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170316:76"/>Commandement, all which conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this threefold pride, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally (as we have ſeen) diſcovers it ſelf in ſuch, as are proud of their gifts. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is in the former part of the third verſe, ſet down both in the negative, [<hi>For this I ſay, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think more highly of himſelf than he ought to think</hi>] and in the affirmative, <hi>But ſoberly.</hi>] The reaſons of both, are in the latter part of that and in the two verſes following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 From the <hi>efficient Cauſe,</hi> or <hi>Author of Gifts,</hi> and that is God,

What Gifts ſoever any one hath, he hath them all from God; <hi>Nemo igitur ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biat ut ſuis,</hi> let no man therefore bee proud of them, as if they were his own. In as much as God gives them, it ſhews that wee have none of our own; this ſhould put us in minde of our own penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and emptineſs, which would bee an humbling conſideration.</p>
                  <p>It is a very uncomely thing for a man to boaſt of that which is not his own, for one that lives by borrowing, to glory in his great eſtate, and it is very unjuſt too; in as much as the glory which is due to his friend, by this means hee transferres upon himſelf.</p>
                  <p>By this Argument, the Apoſtle endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to take down the pride of the puſt

                  <p>Again, the eye doth not hate the eare, becauſe the eare hears, which the eye doth not; nor the eare hate the eye, becauſe the eye ſees, which the eare doth not; the hand doth not hate the foot becauſe the foot walks, which the hand doth not; nor the foot the hand, becauſe the hand works, which the foot doth not; but are mutually ſerviceable one to the other, in procuring the good of the whole body, whereof they are joynt members.<note n="b" place="margin">

And thus much of this firſt particular, wherein thoſe that have Gifts are to deny Self in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170316:78"/>reſpect of Gifts. In the next place,</p>
                  <p>For thoſe that have Gifts, to deny Self in reſpect of Gifts, is,</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Not to <hi>preſume</hi> upon them. As ſome that have Grace without<note n="c" place="margin">i. e.

As their gifts and perſonal endowments fill themſelves with conceit and admiration, ſo they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect they ſhould produce the like effect in others that doe obſerve them, yea that God alſo ſhould reſpect them the more for them. And theſe are of two ſorts, ſuch as preſume upon their Natural gifts, and ſuch as preſume upon their Spiritual gifts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Such as preſume upon their <hi>Natural gifts;</hi> theſe look upon themſelves as cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious pieces of Natures Workmanſhip, and therefore perſwade themſelves they are the objects of heavens love.

<q> God hath imprinted ſo many Characters of his Image upon my perſon, enabled my perſon with ſo many rare endowments, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brightned my underſtanding with orient beams of knowledge, by which I can finde out the moſt hidden ſecrets of Nature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered unto reaſon that dominion and authority, which my unruly and ſeditious paſſions had uſurped and extorted from it, beautified my body with purity of complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170316:78"/>eminency of ſtature, proportion of parts; and ſhall I not hence conclude that I am greatly beloved of God? Are ſuch Silver veſſels made to diſhonour? Is there not rubbiſh enough in the world beſides to be thrown out of the City of God? Muſt the ſame fate take hold on me likewiſe? I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thus perſwade my ſelf. Surely theſe communicated excellencies from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf are ſtrong arguments to me, of the love and good will of God towards me, more than to many thouſands that want them, ſo that I need not fear that I ſhall beacaſt-away in the end.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus doe many ſelf-conceited perſons delude themſelves, vainly imagining that becauſe of theſe Natural and Moral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments of theirs, they are made fit for ſociety and fellowſhip with God. O would men but ſeriouſly take notice of the concluſions that they make in their ſecret reflections upon themſelves! they would acknowledge that what they now read is true.</p>
                  <p>This is that, and all that which bears up the ſpirits of many great Schollars, and many of the Gallants and great ones, that ſit at the upper end of the world, with a vaine confidence that all is well with them at preſent, and that it ſhall be well with them hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Such as preſume upon <hi>Spiritual Gifts,</hi> theſe think they have more to bee
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170316:79"/>confident upon than the former; for thus they plead for themſelves? We are inlightned, not onely to ſee into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of nature, but into the more hidden myſteries of the Goſpel,

                  </p>
                  <p>What ground had <hi>Samuel</hi> thus to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude? No other but becauſe of the beauty of his countenance, this gave him a fitneſs for the Crown in <hi>Samuels</hi> eye. But God reproves him for it, and ſaid, <hi>Look not upon his countenance or on the height of his ſtature, becauſe I have refuſed him; for the Lord ſeeth not as man ſeeth, for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart,</hi> 1 Sam. 16.7.

God looks at the heart, and hee looks at grace in the heart. What ever the Cabinet bee, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the Pearl that is in it moſt of all. God reſpects the heart as it hath a new draught of his own image upon it, if this be wanting, though all other natural per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections be preſent, yet there is no beauty which God reſpects.</p>
                  <p>God did not regard <hi>Abſolom</hi> for his beauty, nor <hi>Achitophel</hi> for his wiſdome, nor <hi>Dives</hi> for his honourable deſcent.

God will not reſpect you for any of theſe things, if you have no better; it may be he may uſe you in ſome particular ſervice, and reward you with ſome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170316:80"/>reward, and afterwards reject you, to be ſure, while thus, hee will never give you the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>When God comes to pick and chooſe for the Kingdome of Heaven, <hi>Not many wiſe not many mighty, not many noble men are called: Where is the wiſe? Where is the Scribe? where is the diſputer of this world?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20. Are not moſt of them this day without <hi>God inthe world?</hi> Are not multitudes of them in Hell already? As for thoſe that preſume upon their ſpiritual gifts, I would wiſh them ſeriouſly to conſider of that anſwer, that ſuch at the laſt day ſhall have from the Lord,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 7.23. Then will I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs unto them, <hi>I never knew you, depart from me yee that work iniquity.</hi> Men of ſuch excellent gifts as have been bleſſed to the conviction, and converſion of many a ſoul, will bee loath to ſuſpect themſelves; But it will bee moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full damnation, after ſo many excellent Sermons preached and printed, ſo many powerfully moving, heart-breaking, and heart-melting prayers and tears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for any one to be damned.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall adde no more, but paſs on to the next particular; for thoſe that have gifts, to deny Self in reſpect of Gifts, is,</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Not to abuſe them in the uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:170316:81"/>Great is the abuſe of Gifts, and Self is as much ſeen in it as in any thing what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 When men exerciſe them about <hi>high things,</hi> that are above, either their
<hi>own,</hi> or <hi>other</hi> mens apprehenſions, whoſe information and inſtruction, they are more eſpecially bound to take care of:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Their own apprehenſions, when they will be medling with things, which either they do not underſtand, or which cannot be underſtood.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Which they do not underſtand,</hi> when they will take upon them to determine in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters whereof they have no certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, nor any wel-grounded experience. It is obſerved of many (in ſome particulars, excellently well skill'd) that they affect nothing more, than to bee undertaking, where they have leaſt ability to perform as they ought. And this is from,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 An eager deſire of glory, and that,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 In being equall to others, who in ſome particulars do excel them; They are impatient of coming ſhort in any thing, thinking it a reflection upon their own worth, that another ſhould do better than themſelves, and therefore they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently begin to imitate, ſtriving to do the like (though contrary to their own ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius) and ſo mar all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In excelling others, who in all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170316:81"/>are even with them. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indure that others ſhould ſtand upon the ſame levell with themſelves, and therefore are ever climbing up to the higher ground, till at length they tumble down lower than before.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Self-confidence, and an over-high opinion and conceit of their own abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whereby they fondly imagine they can do any thing as well, or better than others; they think nothing is too hard for them, but that they ſhall either finde a way, or make one to their deſired glory. As ſome deſpairing of their own ſufficiency, ſhun thoſe imployments wherein had they confidence anſwerable to their abilities, they might do wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, ſo others preſuming upon it, make many fruitleſs adventures, to the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of themſelves, and detriment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>Other things might bee mentioned to ſhew how much of Self there is in this Abuſe, but they are all, or moſt of them reducible unto theſe two Generals, which indeed are the principal cauſes of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abuſe alſo, which is, when they will bee medling with things,</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Which cannot bee underſtood,</hi> when they will bee aſpiring, and reaching after the knowledge of things <hi>not revealed,</hi> when they will bee trying to unlock and open thoſe <hi>ſecret and reſerved mysteries,</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:170316:82"/>which the counſel of God hath wiſely ſhut up, and hid from their eyes.</p>
                  <p>Some imploy all their ſtudies to finde out the principles of Mettals and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn them otherwiſe than before they have been, that from thence may reſult a <hi>Catholick Medicine</hi> for the perfecting of imperfect Mettals, and for reſtoring of ſick and decayed bodies of what ſort ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; and theſe are they that ſtile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Students in the moſt Divine myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Hermetick learning.</hi>

                  <p>Some caſt it up juſt how long it ſhall be to the day of Judgement. Others how many Centuries it ſhall laſt.</p>
                  <p>Some beat their brains to finde out what God was doing before hee made the world: Others to know whether there bee not more worlds than one, whether the ſtars bee not peopled and inhabited in like manner as the earth is.</p>
                  <p>Some try experiments for finding out the <hi>firſt common matter</hi> of all things: Others that they may ſee the <hi>naked eſſence</hi> of any thing.</p>
                  <p>Some inquire into the <hi>eſtate of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> and they tell us that ſome of them are mortal, alſo how many years they

                  <p>Some inquire where heaven is to bee after the day of Judgement, and tell us that Chriſt ſhall reign upon the earth, and all the Saints with him for ever: Others dig deep to finde out the place of the damned, and they tell us, that at the center of the earth is the fire of hell, and that it is kindled by the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Mobile,</hi> and influences of the Stars.</p>
                  <p>I might quickly fill up many pages, ſhould I proceed to ſet down but one half of the many groſs fopperies, and monſtrous conceptions, that have been Midwifed into the world by theſe, and ſuch like bold and preſumptuous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries of fanatick <hi>Chymists,</hi> and

                  <p>Thus wee ſee how much of Self there is in it, when men exerciſe their gifts about high things, that are above their own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. The next particular is, when they exerciſe them about high things that are above,</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Other mens apprehenſions, whoſe information and inſtruction, they are more eſpecially bound to take care of. This is the uſual fault of many great Scholars that are Preachers, that though they do not ſtudy ſuch things as are above their own capacities, yet they preach ſuch things as are above the capacities of the greateſt part of their hearers. In popular Aſſemblies ſome fall upon thoſe knotty diſputes and controverſies, which at leaſt as they handle them) were much fitter for the Schools, than the Pulpit. Others do ſo cloud and obſcure their Sermons
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170316:84"/>with ſuch variety of reading, and ancient hiſtory, ſuch ſubtile ſpeculations of Metaphyſicks, ſuch a multitude of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſe and difficult termes of Art, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth alluſions, and hidden method, that the common people can make nothing of what they ſay, nor reap any benefit by it, verily there is much of Self in ſuch kinde of preaching, for as much as it proceeds from</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Pride and haughtineſs of ſpirit. They think it Self-denial enough that men of ſuch parts, and learning, and degrees, as themſelves, will condeſcend to preach to any, they need not condeſcend lower in preaching to every ones capacity. They lay aſide much of that honour which their <hi>Wiſdomes</hi> might otherwiſe have, in that they will daign to preach, ſhall they lay aſide their learning too? Beſides, is it fit the <hi>chief Maſter</hi> of the School ſhould teach the <hi>Pettits?</hi> Let an <hi>Uſher</hi> be provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for them, for their parts they will take no pains about them. Thus they leave the ignorant, and unlearned to ſhift for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as well as they can; if they can pick any thing now and then out of their learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſcourſes, it is well for them, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſhall never be taught by them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Deſire of credit and applauſe. They preach in this manner.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That <hi>the learned</hi> may commend them; They would have it known that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170316:84"/>they are learned, and that they would have the praiſe of their learning. They would have it taken notice of what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency they have made in their ſtudies, what

If providence ſo order it that their lot falls amongſt an ignorant people, it is not long before they grow weary, and they deſire a <hi>more knowing</hi> people, not a people more knowing of Chriſt, and his Doctrine, but more able to know them, and their ability in preaching.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That the <hi>ignorant</hi> and unlearned may admire them.

                  <p n="2">2 When men exerciſe them about <hi>low things,</hi> that are beneath the dignity of their own, and other mens under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, to bee much converſant in them. When they do

Chriſt requires that wee ſhould loſe our life in order to our finding it, that wee ſhould loſe our finful, and ſometimes our natural life, in order to our finding ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal life, and ſo makes that which is the <hi>right Self-ſeeking indeed,</hi> the end of Self-denial.

                  <p n="1">1 By propounding ſomething which in it ſelf is evill, under the ſhew and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of good. Many men ſeem very active and zealous in many good works, but they have very ungodly ends, that which they aim at in the doing of them, is ſome wicked thing. We have divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Balaam,</hi> when <hi>Balak</hi> the King of <hi>Moab</hi> ſent to him to curſe the <hi>Iſraelites, hee would conſult with God,</hi> and <hi>profeſſed, that if the King would give him his houſe full of gold and ſilver, hee durst not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the word of the Lord to do leſs or more,</hi> Numb. 22.8-18. Oh how ſcrupulous was <hi>Balaam</hi> now! What a tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience had hee! one would have thought that the thing hee aimed at, was to do as God would have him, but no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it was to do as <hi>Balak would have him,</hi> it was that hee might (if it were poſſible) get leave to curſe the people of God. Thus many men ſearch the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but it is to ſee if they can pick out any thing that may make for ſome wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked practiſe, which they have a minde to continue, or <hi>againſt</hi> ſome good duty, which they have no minde to perform. Thus many men flock after Sermons, and one would think that they meant
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170316:95"/>to practice what they hear, but it is true of them, as God ſaid of<note n="l" place="margin">Ezek. 33.31.</note> 
                     <hi>Ezekiels hearers,</hi> They come unto the Miniſter,
<hi>as the people cometh;</hi> and <hi>they ſit before him</hi> as Gods people, and they <hi>hear his words, but they will not do them,</hi> for <hi>with their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetouſneſs;</hi> their heart goes after ſome baſe wicked luſt, or other, and they hope that ſomething may bee ſaid for the countenancing of it, but if not, they are reſolved to follow it notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And thus many come with caſes and ſcruples of conſcience, but it is onely to get ſomething that may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them in their evill wayes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Abner,</hi> after a long war that hee had waged againſt <hi>David</hi> on the behalf of <hi>Iſhboſheth Sauls</hi> ſon, hee bound him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by a ſolemn oath to fight for
<hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 3.9, 10. <hi>So do God to</hi> Abner, <hi>and more alſo, except as the Lord hath ſworn to</hi> David, <hi>even ſo I do unto him: To tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Kingdome from the houſe of</hi> Saul <hi>and to ſet up the Throne of</hi> David <hi>over</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>and over</hi> Judah, <hi>from</hi> Dan <hi>even to</hi> Beer-ſheba. One might have thought that
<hi>Abner</hi> had repented of his oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt <hi>David,</hi> but that it was to bee revenged upon <hi>Iſhboſheth,</hi> who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him for going into his Fathers Concubine, verſ. 7. <hi>And</hi> Iſhboſheth <hi>ſaid to</hi> Abner, <hi>Wherefore haſt thou gone in

<hi>&amp;c. except as the Lord hath ſworn to</hi> David, <hi>ſo I do unto him.</hi> Now hee ſwears to do unto <hi>David</hi> as the Lord had ſworn; this was his duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but hee would not do it all this while, till ſuch time as <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> croſt him in his luſt, and then to croſs <hi>Iſhboſheth</hi> hee would do his duty. I will leave the application to the Reader.</p>

                  <p>Thus many men (wee ſee) pretend the publick good, when it is their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate benefit, and advantage, that they onely aim at; they are very zealous and active inſtirring up others to contribute liberally, and ſuch and ſuch good uſes they pretend, but it is <hi>that they may ſteal for themſelves,</hi> which is evident, in that they convert ſo much of what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, to their own uſe afterwards.</p>

Thus many make great ſhews of holineſs, that others taking them to be conſcientious and honeſt men, may truſt them with their eſtates, and then they will bee ſure to cheat them. But that no imputation (in caſe it ſhould bee divulged) may faſten upon them, they ſtill continue their long prayers, and other religious exerciſes, truſting thereupon, that what-ever is laid to their charge (they having ſo great a name for proſeſſion) it will never bee credited.</p>
                  <p>This then is one way of Selfes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the queſtion, by propounding ſomething which is evil in it ſelf, under
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170316:97"/>the notion of good. There is another, and that is,</p>
                  <p n="2">2 By propounding ſomething which is good in it ſelf, under the notion of the chief good. Self never propounds that which is the chief good in deed for its end in any good work; but ſome other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour good under the notion of the chief good. God is the chief good, and in this ſenſe, there is nothing good but God, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.17. But Self never propounds God for its end. It often propounds him for a means in order to ſome other good beneath him, but it never propounds him for himſelf. It is ſomething beſides God, that Self acts for in all that it doth; but that which it acts for, it acts for it as it's God, becauſe what ever it acts for, it acts for it as it's chief good. That which Self acts for as its chief end in any thing that it doth, that it acts for as its chief good; for, as to be an end, and to bee good, are all one, ſo to bee the chief end, and to bee the chief good. Now whatſoever Self acts for beſides God (as all that it acts for, is ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides God) it acts for it as its chief end; therefore whatſoever it acts for, it acts for it as it's chief good, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently as its God. The chief thing that the Glutton acts for, is the filling of his belly, and therefore his belly is ſaid to bee his God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. The chief thing that the Covetous acts for, is his Money, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170316:97"/>Money is his God, therefore Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs is ſaid to bee Idolatry,
<hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. and a covetous man is called an Idolater, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. And this is not onely true of covetouſneſs but of every other vice, that it is<note n="n" place="margin">

See more in <hi>Eng. Annot.</hi> on <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Ed.</note> Idolatry; becauſe thereby Self acts for ſomething beſides God as its chief good, and therefore as its God. To act for ſomething beſides God, in ſubordination unto God, as the ſupreme end, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Self in it; ſuch an end is not to bee deemed a ſelf-end. But then it is a ſelf-end when a man acts for ſomething beſides God as his chief end, when ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides God (though good in it ſelf, and that which may lawfully bee aimed at) is the chief thing that moves him to, and carries him through the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of any duty, ſo that were it not for that thing, hee would not ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, hee would not perſevere in it. Thus it is whenſoever Self hath the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of the Queſtion. That ſuch a thing is the will of God, and makes for the glory of God, and that communion with God is to bee had in it, are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that can do nothing with Self, but this conſideration, that it makes for ones worldly profit, or pleaſure, or honour, prevails preſently. Come to a ſelfiſh man, and tell him that this is his duty, that the Law of God requires it that God will be well-pleaſed with it, and that hee will
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170316:98"/>reward it hereafter in heaven; theſe things make no impreſſion upon him; but tell him that hee ſhall get in with ſuch a party as will promote him to honour, that hee ſhall have a place of preferment, a good office, that will bring him in ſo much by the year, and this wins him preſently. This hath won off a great many in our dayes to a form of godlineſs, which before they could never endure, and the power whereof for the preſent, they ſtill deny. Convictions from the <hi>word</hi> are pretended, but convictions from the
<hi>world</hi> are the cauſe. Where one is wrought upon by convictions from the word, there are hundreds that are wrought upon by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions onely from the world. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and honour, the pleaſures and profits of the world, are the onely things that many of thoſe that ſeem moſt zealous in the Profeſſion of Religion, do moſt zealouſly follow after. There are many whoſe faces are Chriſt-wards, but (like <hi>Skullers</hi>) they row with all their might to quite contrary objects.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that they are ſaid to go <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way backward,</hi> Iſa. 1.4. Wee read of thoſe that came along with <hi>Judas</hi> to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Chriſt, that as ſoon as hee ſpake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, they <hi>went backward, and fell to the ground,</hi> Joh. 18.6. Theſe came as profeſſed enemies to Chriſt, others though they come as profeſſed friends,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170316:98"/>yet are reall enemies to him, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though natural conſcience or ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon works of the Spirit, may drive them in an outward profeſſion towards Chriſt, yet ſo ſtrong is their inbred enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and ſecret antipathy againſt him, and ſo powerfull their ſympathy with the world, that ere long they go backward and fall to the ground their proper place; <hi>Duſt to duſt, Earth to earth, Aſhes to aſhes.</hi> Many that for a long time together, have ſeemed to walk hand in hand with Chriſt, have in the interim been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing backward, and at laſt have fallen to the ground.</p>
                  <p>Men may bee a long time going back before they fall, but obſerve it, ordinarily they fall to ground. This is a pretty fallacy, whereby multitudes of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours think to cheat their brethren a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whom they live; in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motion they go forward with the reſt of the company (and it may bee will bee Ring-leaders) but in their inward motion they go backwards. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith of <hi>Iſrael, Hee ſlideth back as a back ſliding Heifer,</hi> Hoſ. 4.16.
<hi>Sliding</hi> is ſometimes an inſenſible motion, and therefore backſliding is elſewhere called a drawing back; ſuch is the retrograde motion of theſe men many times, one cannot perceive them going till they bee gone. This is the manner of <hi>worldling</hi>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:170316:99"/>Profeſſours, they keep their eye upon God, and his people, and then in the mean while ſlide back, and by little and little ſteal away that none may perceive them; or if they bee eſpied, they may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thoſe that ſhall taxe them, that they are in the ſame poſture that they were before. Thus it is with many, and wee cannot perceive them preſently, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.5. <hi>For neither at any time uſed wee flattering words as yee know, nor a cloak of covetouſneſs God knows.</hi> If wee had flattered, yee could ſoon have diſcerned that, but wee might have been covetous, and yee could not have known it, onely God could have diſcerned that. Its God onely that muſt judge of the hypocriſie of divers, yet there are others whoſe hypocritical warping, and recidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is viſible to all that have but one eye open to behold them.</p>
                  <p>Some mens ſins go before, and are manifeſt, others are ſecret, and follow after. It is eaſie and ordinary for men to pretend one thing, and intend another; ordinary and common to pretend ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, and yet even then to ſeek themſelves, and the things of the world, more than Chriſt. Chriſt told the people, that came to <hi>Capernaum</hi> ſeeking for him, <hi>Yee ſeek mee, not becauſe yee ſaw the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, but becauſe yee did eat of the loaves and were filled,</hi> Joh. 6.26. <hi>Simon Magus</hi>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:170316:99"/>beleeved, and was baptized, but the chief thing hee aimed at, was that hee might bee a great man, and that hee might get as much then by giving of the Holy Ghoſt, as hee had got by conjuting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.19. It may haply go for a Paradox with ſome, That one that hath lived all his dayes looſely and vainly, in contempt of Chriſt, and his Ordinances, ſhould at length take upon him a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Religion, frequent the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and practice ſeveral duties of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, meerly in purſuance of the world and the things of the world, but it is a moſt certain Truth; A wicked man that is unconverted, may change his <hi>way,</hi> but hee can never change his <hi>end.</hi> A man may have the ſame end in frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ordinances, that hee had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when hee frequented
<hi>Play-houſes,</hi> or the <hi>Stews.</hi> Hee may bee much in hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, praying, faſting, and talking of the Scripture, and yet ſeek himſelf, and the things of the world, as his chief end in all theſe wayes. See <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.5. <hi>When yee faſted and mourned in the fifth, and ſeventh month, did yee at all faſt unto mee? even to mee? and when yee did eat, and when yee did drink did yee not eat for your ſelves, and drink for your ſelves?</hi> The like God ſaith of the ten Tribes, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 7.14. <hi>They have not cryed unto mee with their heart, when they howled upon their beds,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170316:100"/>they aſſemble themſelves for Corn and Wine, and they rebel againſt mee;</hi> and in the 16. verſe, <hi>They return, but not to the moſt High.</hi> Godlineſs is profitable for all things, having the promiſes of this life, as well as of the life to come; and

                  <p>Hereupon many make uſe of God and Religion, onely to gain temporal things from him, and ſo make him who is the laſt end, and higheſt good, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument or means to attain that which is far below him. <hi>Jehu</hi> was very zealous for the Lord, and marched on furiouſly in executing the Judgement threatned againſt the houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> but his end was to eſtabliſh the Kingdome upon himſelf and his poſterity. The Scribes and Phariſees were very ſtrict and preciſe, and abundant in many good duties, they gave Almes, they kept dayes of faſting and humiliation twice a week, but their end was vain-glory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.1. and getting of money, chap. 23.14. ſo eaſie a thing it is under the vizard of Religion, to ſeek the accompliſhment of the baſeſt end whatſoever.

What cares the Devil, the Prince of this world that rules in the children of diſobedience; what cares hee, I ſay, that ſome of his vaſſals now and then offer to God a ſacrifice without an heart? that they draw near to him with their mouth, while they leave their heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde them? I have read that it was the <hi>Watch-word</hi> among the Papiſts after Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the Crown, <hi>My ſon give mee thy heart;</hi> bee in heart a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170316:101"/>Papiſt, and then go to Church, it matters not. The Devil can keep his ſupremacy notwithſtanding ſuch an outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with God; and truly it is but an outward compliance with God in a few external duties and formalities of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, that the generality of thoſe that call themſelves Proteſtants, not to ſay Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, are guilty of; <hi>With their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goes after their covetouſneſs, as God ſaith of</hi> Ezekiels <hi>hearers,</hi> Ezek. 33.31.</p>
                  <p>And this is the other way of Selfes anſwering the Queſtion, by propounding ſomething which is good in it ſelf, under the notion of the chief good.</p>
                  <p>Two things therefore are here requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by way of Self-denial in every good work.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Not to intend any thing that is evill in it ſelf, though it ſeem never ſo good. If wee may not do evill that good may come thereof (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.8.) much leſs then may wee do good, that evill may come thereof. To pervert but a civill Ordinance (as <hi>buying,</hi> and
<hi>ſelling, &amp;c.</hi>) to the fulfilling of any ſinful luſt, is a very great wickedneſs, and that which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly provokes God, <hi>Micb.</hi> 6.10. Much more to pervert a ſpiritual Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance (as faſting, and praying, and preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) as
<hi>ſhee</hi> did, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.9. and <hi>they,</hi> Phil. 1.15. This is to make
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170316:101"/>Chriſt a ſervant to Sathan, to throw down Chriſts Scepter at Sathans feet, and to make it ſubſervient to the advancing of his Kindgome of darkneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Not any thing that is good in it ſelf, but not the chief good, under the notion of the chief good. Riches, and Honours, and Pleaſures, are good in themſelves, and ſuch things as wee may lawfully make our end, but they are not the <hi>chief good,</hi> and therefore wee may not make any of them our <hi>chief end.</hi> God is to bee our chief end in every thing that wee do, and other things onely as they bee ſubordinate unto God. <hi>Whether therefore yee eat, or drink</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>or what ever yee do, do all to the</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">There is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to an action truly good, that at leaſt virtually it bee referred to God, as to the chief end. <hi>Ames Marrow of Divin.</hi> l. 2. cap. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.31. Therefore when ever Self propounds any thing beſides God, as the chief mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to perſwade us to any duty, wee muſt reject it. Though never ſo many worldly advantages bee offered us, wee may not much regard them. Wee muſt do our duty upon another account; nay though they ſhould bee denied us, wee may not neglect our duty: Therefore wee muſt ſerve God with as much zeal in <hi>private</hi> where no man can behold us, as wee would do in
<hi>publick,</hi> where the multitude may obſerve us. Wee muſt bee as lively and active in time of <hi>adverſity,</hi> when wee are deſtitute of all things, as
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170316:102"/>we would be in time of proſperity, when wee have all that our heart can wiſh for. God is attainable ſtill, in all places, and in all conditions, and it ſhould not much trouble us that wee miſs of the leſs prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal end, ſo that wee obtain that which is the principal.</p>
                  <p>And thus much of the firſt particular, The denying all Self-ends in the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; The next is the Denying,</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>All Self-ſufficiency in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</hi> If wee have any well-grounded evidence of a ſpiritual power in our ſelves to do any thing that is good, wee may not deny that wee have it, (as I have ſhewn<note n="p" place="margin">Sub-ſectl. pag. 45.</note> before) but yet wee muſt deny that wee have it of our ſelves. <hi>Not that wee are ſufficient of our ſelves</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>to think any thing as of our ſelves, but all our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. without a freſh income and ſupply of grace from him who is full of grace, <hi>wee can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> as Joh. 15.5. And therefore wee muſt not go about any thing with <hi>Self-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> as if wee could do it without him, but ſtill look up unto him for more grace. In every action, as there muſt bee an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of our
<hi>obedience;</hi> ſo likewiſe of our <hi>dependence.</hi> As we muſt live <hi>unto</hi> God, ſo likewiſe wee muſt live <hi>upon</hi> God, and wee muſt live <hi>upon</hi> him, that wee may bee able to live <hi>unto</hi> him. Wee cannot glorifie God in any thing that wee do,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170316:102"/>unleſs wee make him both the <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega</hi> of it. That cannot bee to <hi>him</hi> as the <hi>end,</hi> that is not <hi>from</hi> him, as the
<hi>cauſe,</hi> and therefore they muſt needs refer all that they do <hi>unto</hi> themſelves, that begin all that they do <hi>from</hi> themſelves. Such men out of the juſt judgement of God, do often meet with the moſt ſhamefull diſappointment, being not able many times after their greateſt prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to anſwer either their own, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens expectations in their publick undertakings. It is but juſt that God ſhould leave us, when wee leave him firſt. Hee is a jealous God, and will not ſuffer it, that his glory ſhould bee given to another. If wee cannot bee content, but wee muſt have the glory of a God, it is not fit, wee ſhould bee allowed the honour of a man. When <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> began to talk of the might of his power, and of the glory of his Majeſty, God drove him from <hi>men,</hi> and turned him a grazing amongſt <hi>beaſts.</hi> This may bee the reaſon therefore, why ſo many men of great parts and learning, are now and then ſmitten with mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; God would have us to ſee that wee are beholding to him for our <hi>working,</hi> as well as for our <hi>being.</hi> The ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whereof would keep us from truſting in our ſelves, and make us look up to him as the <hi>firſt mover,</hi> in all that wee
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170316:103"/>have to do, by which means wee ſhould engage him to bee with us, and then wee ſhould bee ſure not to miſcarry. Thus of this ſecond particular. <hi>The denying all Self-ſufficiency in the undertaking.</hi> Wee are to deny,</p>

<hi>Thorah Begnalpe.</hi> This latter they called <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> or the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Law, and received it as a Comment, or Expoſition of the former. And herein they differed from the

This principle being granted (which the Papiſts very much contend for) there is a door wide open for all manner of humane inventions and fopperies to enter in, and juſtle out the Commands of God.

This they learned from the Phariſees, whoſe Religion was nothing elſe but a medly of ſuperſtition, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſuch obſervances for the moſt part, as were not onely beſides, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the expreſs Commands of God, which was the main reaſon why our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170316:104"/>was ſo bitter in his invectives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, <hi>calling</hi> them Fools, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, Blinde-guides, Serpents, and a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Vipers; and <hi>threatning</hi> them with wrath and vengeance above all other ſorts of people with whom hee had to do. Wee read of <hi>eight Woes</hi> that hee denounced againſt them in one Chapter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.13, 14,
15, 16, 23, 25, 27, 29. verſes. And indeed there is nothing whereby a people do more provoke the Lord to anger, than this, that they make the <hi>teachings</hi> of men (though handed down unto them by never ſo many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations) the rule of their obedience. See how hee threatned the
<hi>Jews,</hi> Iſa. 29.13. <hi>For as much as this people draw near mee with their mouth, and with their lips do honour mee, but have removed their heart far from me, and their fear towards mee is taught by the precepts of men; Therefore behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work, and a wonder, for the wiſdome of their wiſe men ſhall periſh, and the underſtanding of their prudent men ſhall hee hid.</hi> Hee calls them the <hi>Generation of his wrath</hi> (a moſt dreadfull expreſſion) <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.29. becauſe they ſet their abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations in the houſe which was called by his Name, to pollute it, and built the high places of <hi>Tophet</hi> in the valley of <hi>Hinnom,</hi> to burn their ſons and daughters in the fire, <hi>Which</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>I command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<hi>Behold the dayes come, that it ſhall no more bee called To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, nor the valley of the ſen of Hinnom, but the valley of Slaughter; for they ſhall bury in Tophet, till there bee no place, and the carkaſſes of this people ſhall bee meat for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beaſts of the earth, and none ſhall fray them away.</hi> This was the great aggravation of their ſin, and that which God doth chiefly remark in the threatning, that they would adventure upon a way of worſhip which hee had not commanded. What ever it bee, though it carry never ſo great a ſhew of Self-denial and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, yet if it hath no better rule than tradition, or the teaching of men, God doth not accept it; nay hee abhors it, and doth uſually (according as hee hath threatned) moſt ſeverely<note n="t" place="margin">If a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſhould lend or give to his Prince a great ſum of money, yet if either all, or any part of it, did appear to his Prince,

Wee are to ſubmit to every Ordinance of man, ſo that it bee not contrary to any Ordinance of God; but if man will take upon him to command what God hath forbidden, and to forbid what God hath commanded, be it never ſo ſmall a circumſtance; in this caſe, though he be the greateſt man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, and have never ſo much power in his hands, wee muſt not regard him.

<hi>whatſoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incenſe to the Queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, as wee have done, wee, and our Fathers.</hi> They pleaded the example of their Fore-fathers. Thus
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170316:106"/>many in our dayes being told of their ſuperſtition, preſently make anſwer, <hi>Shall wee bee wiſer than our Fore-fathers? Had not they ſouls to ſave as well as wee? They would not have done as they did, had it not been lawful.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 The example of great ones. This was that which the Phariſees objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

                  <p n="3">3 The example of the Multitude. This was <hi>Demetrius</hi> his argument againſt
<hi>Paul</hi> on the behalf of <hi>Diana, That all Aſia and the world did worſhip her,</hi> and therefore the doctrine of <hi>Paul, that they bee no gods which are made with hands,</hi> was falſe and not to bee ſuffered.
<q>
                        <hi>This Paul</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>hath perſwaded and turned away much people, ſaying, That they bee no gods which are made with hands,</hi> ſo that, <hi>not onely this our Craft is in danger to bee ſet at nought, but alſo that the Temple of the Great Goddeſs</hi> Diana
<hi>ſhould bee deſpiſed,</hi> and her magnificence <hi>ſhould</hi> bee deſtroyed,

                  <p>Theſe bee the examples that Self uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally propounds for our direction, but none of them are our rule. As for the firſt, God threatens to viſite the ſins of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers upon the Children, unto the third and fourth Generation of thoſe that hate him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.5. this is chiefly meant of thoſe that continue in the ſins of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.

And for the third, our Saviour tells us, that the way the moſt doe walk in, is the way that leads to deſtruction. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.13, 14.</p>
                  <p>The Rule that God hath given us to obſerve, inſtead of all theſe, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe Self at any time preſcribeth for our direction in any of our undertakings, is <hi>his Law</hi> ſet downe in the Scriptures. <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimony,</hi> Iſa. 8.20. <hi>Wee have a more ſure word of Propheſie,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.19. This is ſufficient to direct us in all particular actions, whether of <hi>Religion,</hi> or <hi>Juſtice,</hi> to acquaint us with
<hi>every good path,</hi> Prov. 2.9. to make us perfect,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170316:107"/>throughly furniſhed <hi>unto all good works,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. and therefore God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that we ſhould have an eye to it in every thing that we do, that ſo we may not turne to the right hand, nor to the left. Therefore as for the Doctrines, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and Examples of men, they are no further to bee regarded than as they are agreeable unto this <hi>Law</hi> of God; it is Gods Prerogative Royal to give Law to the Conſcience, he will not ſuffer a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to uſurpe it, neither may wee. And thus of this third particular of Self-denial in reſpect of good works, the denying all Self-rules in the direction. The laſt is,</p>
                  <p n="4">4 All Self-praiſe in the review, Praiſe is nothing elſe but a reflection of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, now there is a two-fold Excellency that men are apt to reflect upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the review of any good work they have done.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 An excellency of Power; <hi>Is not this great Babilon</hi> (ſaid
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>) <hi>that I have built for the houſe of the Kingdome, by the might of my power, and for the glory</hi> of my Majeſty, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.30. So they, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos</hi> 6.13.
<hi>Have wee not taken us Horns by our owne ſtrength?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 An excellency of Merit; <hi>Wherefore have we faſted</hi> (ſay they) <hi>and thou ſeeſt not? Wherefore have wee afflicted our ſoule and thou takeſt no knowledge?</hi> Iſa.
58.3. They thought they deſerved ſomething
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170316:107"/>for their faſting and praying, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that God wronged them, in not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them that they came for.</p>
                  <p>Two things therefore are here requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Not to glory in any thing that wee have done, as if wee had done it by our owne ſtrength, without any help or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from God; <hi>Beware that thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not the Lord thy God, in not keeping his Commandements, leaſt when thou haſt eaten and art full, and haſt built goodly houſes and dwelt therein, and thy ſilver and thy gold is multiplied, then thine heart bee lifted up, and thou forget the Lord thy God, and thou ſay in thine heart, my power, and the might of my hand hath gotten me this wealth; but thou ſhalt remember the Lord thy God, for it is hee that giveth thee power to get wealth,</hi> Deut. 8.11, 12, 13, 14. — 17,
18. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, let not the wiſe man glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his wiſdome, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, but let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he underſtandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord, which exerciſe loving kindneſſe, judgement, and righteouſneſſe in the earth,</hi> Jer. 9.23, 24. <hi>Wee have this treaſure in earthen veſſels,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.7. <hi>And the Weatons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling downe of ſtrong holds,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.4.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170316:108"/>and therefore telling what himſelf had done, as much more than had been done by the reſt of the Apoſtles, hee corrects himſelf, and acknowledgeth the efficacy of the grace of God, <hi>I laboured more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. And thus ſhould wee ſay after every performance, we have laboured in ſuch a duty (and it may bee more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) yet not wee, but the grace of God which was with us; wee ſhould ſay, as Numb. 23.23. <hi>What hath God wrought!</hi> wondring at the mercy and goodneſſe of God towards us, in inabling us to doe in any meaſure that which hee requires of us, which otherwiſe wee could not have done; as
<hi>David,</hi> 1 Chron. 29.14. <hi>Who am I, and what is my people, that we ſhould be able to offe ſo willingly after this ſort!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 Not to glory in any thing that wee have done, as if we thereby deſerved any thing at Gods hands.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Wee cannot deſerve any thing by the payment of a<note n="y" place="margin">Dare enim vel reddere alicuidebitum, non eſt mereli, ſed ſatisfacere, Rivet in Pſal. 19.170. a.</note> debt; <hi>Which of you,</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>having a ſervant plowing, or feeding Cattle, will ſay unto him by and by, when hee is come from the field, Goe and ſit downe to meat, and will not rather ſay unto him, Make ready where-with I may ſup, and gird thy ſelf, and ſerve mee till I have eaten and drunken? — Doth hee thank that ſervant becauſe he did the things
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170316:108"/>that were commanded him? I trow not; ſo likewiſe yee, when yee ſhall have done all thoſe things that are commanded you, ſay, wee are unprofitable ſervants,</hi> wee have done that which was our duty to doe, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Wee cannot deſerve any thing that is not our owne; but our good works are not our owne, wee doe them not by our owne ſtrength, wee are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think the leaſt good thought, but all our ſufficiency is of God, it is hee that works all our works in us, and for us, that works in us both to will and to doe of his good pleaſure. When wee have done any thing for God, wee muſt ſay as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> if wee will ſay truly, O Lord, of thine owne have wee given thee, for all things are of thee; wee have nothing but what wee have received, wee can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but as it is given us from above, even from God who is the giver of every good and perfect gift. It muſt bee ſomething therefore which wee did not receive from God that wee doe for him, elſe wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not merit by it. But <hi>who hath firſt given to him</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>[let him ſpeak] and it ſhall bee recompenced unto him againe, for of him and through him are all things;</hi> Rom. 11.35.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Wee cannot deſerve by any thing that is unprofitable, and of no advantage unto God; but ſuch are all our good
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170316:109"/>works, they are profitable indeed to our ſelves, and other men, but not to God. Can a man bee profitable unto God (ſaith <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaz</hi>) as hee that is wiſe may bee profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto himſelf? <hi>Is it any pleaſure to the Almighty that thou art righteous? or is it gaine to him that thou makeſt thy ſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect?</hi> Job 22.2, 3.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Wee cannot deſerve to be rewarded by the doing of that which bears no<note n="z" place="margin">Ubi enim eſt magna inae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitas, ut ſi principatus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur alicui pro aliquâſententiâ cum judicio prolata, non eſt meritum ſed donum ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer. River. ibi</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the reward; but betwixt our good works and the reward, there is no proportion; our good works are not <hi>tanti,</hi> they are not ſo much worth, that eternal life ſhould be given for them; our <hi>light</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances cannot (in this ſenſe) <hi>work for us a farre more exceeding eternal weight of glory.</hi> Therefore when ever any ſuch proud conceits of deſerving doe ariſe in our hearts (as riſe they will, ſo long as any thing of Self is in us) we muſt endeavour to ſuppreſſe them, caſting our ſelves whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Free Grace and mercy of God in Chriſt, pleading his righteouſneſſe, and expecting whatever wee ſtand in need of upon his account. And ſo much for this third Subſection of denying Self in reſpect of good works.</p>

But in <hi>intellectual</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> Creatures, as <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Men;</hi> it is a motion of their wills, by which they move after it according to the guidance and direction of their l judgements. Now, all men agree in this, that they would be happy, and that they muſt goe to ſomething out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for it. Man is not a Self-ſufficient Creature, in his <hi>beſt eſtate</hi> hee was <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively poor,</hi> and did precariouſly ſubſiſt upon a richer goodneſſe out of himſelf; he was <hi>then</hi> taught to goe abroad for his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe, having nothing of his owne to live on, but what hee freely received from another; but <hi>now</hi> hee is
<hi>privatively</hi> poor, hee hath <hi>ſuffered the ſpoyling of his goods,</hi> which he had when hee firſt began the world, and therefore is in continual motion after ſomething which may fully <hi>repair</hi> his loſſes, and re-inveſt him in his former glory and happineſſe again.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 What man's Happineſſe is, wherein his chiefeſt good doth conſiſt, and how it may bee obtained, is fully declared in the Goſpel. What is the Goſpel but tidings of felicity, and true bleſſedneſſe? good news for miſerable and undone man; it is nothing elſe but a Directory to guide him to the <hi>chief good,</hi> that which points unto him where his great ſtrength lies, wherein
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170316:114"/>his onely happineſs doth conſiſt, and how hee may bee poſſeſſed of it, by putting him into the way that leads unto it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 It determines the fruition of God to bee mans chiefeſt good. God abſolutely conſidered is the object of all our happines, <hi>leſſe</hi> than whom wee <hi>cannot</hi> have, <hi>more</hi> than whom wee <hi>need</hi> not have, to make us happy. Hee onely is an object pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to that vaſt and boundleſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of felicity and goodneſs that is in man, which cannot bee ſatisfied but by the fruition of an univerſal good, which God onely is.

Thus like the men of <hi>Sodome,</hi> that being ſtruck blinde, wearied themſelves in vain to finde out <hi>Lots</hi> door, they go groping up and down, <hi>if perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture they might feel after it, and finde it,</hi> but tread not one ſtep in the way that leads unto it.</p>
                  <p>Though the Goſpel hold forth God in Chriſt as the chiefeſt good, and perſwade men to look upon him under this notion, yet they being <hi>blinded by the god of this world,</hi> apprehend their chiefeſt good to bee in other things, and ſuppoſe that if they can bee poſſeſſed of them, they <hi>are made,</hi> if they loſe them, they are <hi>utterly undone,</hi> which is the common language of carnall men that know not God. Such perſons though they do not expreſly ſay, There is no God, yet in their practice
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170316:115"/>they ſpeak as much, and in their thoughts they perſwade themſelves ſo, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1. <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, There is no God.</hi> Hee will not, hee dare not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs openly that there is no God, and that it is in vaine to ſerve him, and to walk humbly and preiſely before him, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bee happy by him alone; no, this hee will not ſpeak openly, but profeſs with the reſt of the people, to ſerve the ſame God that they do, but in his heart ſecretly hee perſwades himſelf that it is ſo, and that Religion is but a policy invented to keep men in order, and that they do beſt who provide moſt for themſelves here, and that it is better to make ſure of a little here, than to expect greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon uncertainties hereafter. I am afraid I have read the language of many a fools heart here preſent, who reſolves with himſelf (as I ſaid before) to ſeek happineſs in the general, but will not ſeek it where the Goſpel tells him it is to bee found, who gives it may bee a Goſpel-direction the hearing, and can bee content the Miniſter ſhould ſpeak of God, and declare unto the world, that this felicity and happineſs that is ſo much ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by every one, is onely to bee found in him; but hee will not, hee cannot bring about his minde to cloſe with it. Hee hath many anxieties upon what hee hath heard, and now and then ſome half per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170316:116"/>ſome languiſhing velleities, ſome faint wiſhings and wouldings after God but hee cannot blow up theſe ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered thoughts into one reall hearty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution for him; hee hath one eye ſtill upon the world, and creature-injoyments, and is reſolved to keep his hold, fearing that if hee ſhould once let go, hee might quickly ſink, and never recover himſelf again.</p>
                  <p>Now whence is this, but that his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is depraved concerning the <hi>chief good?</hi> and therefore hee concludes, there is no other happineſs than what may be had in earthly things: Therefore though God make never ſo great offers of other things unto him, though hee tell him of
<hi>grace</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> hee regards it not; nay though hee offer <hi>himſelf</hi> unto him, though hee tell him, <hi>Hee will bee his exceeding great reward,</hi> upon condition that hee will <hi>walke before him, and bee perfect,</hi> hee makes no other reckoning of it, then as hee apprehends ſome earthly thing to bee meant by it. Even as the <hi>Jews,</hi> who when Chriſt told them, <hi>Hee was the bread of God that cometh down from heaven, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth life unto the world,</hi> were much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Lord evermore give us this bread,</hi> Joh. 6.34. But when afterwards they underſtood it was ſuch bread as was to bee eaten by faith, they cried out, <hi>This is an hard ſaying,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170316:116"/>who can hear it,</hi> verſ. 60. Worldly men cannot indure to think of being happy by God alone, they cannot conceive its poſſible, that that good which is in the creatures, ſhould bee found in <hi>him</hi> without the creatures. They onely judge of what is before them, they apprehend no other reality, and beleeve no other than what they apprehend; therefore whatſoever is ſaid of ſpiritualls ſeems a meer contradiction unto them, an utter impoſſibility: Therefore they ſay in their hearts, There is no God, no heaven, no life eternal, becauſe they ſee not things that are inviſible. They wonder what men mean when they talk of being happy in a way of communion with, and conformity unto God, they count them a company of fools, and mad men that will forgo that happineſs which they might have in this preſent world, for they know not what imaginary happineſs (ſo they judge it) is in another world to come. Hence they are prejudiced againſt the wayes of godlineſs, and think it not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a
<hi>vain,</hi> but a <hi>dangerous</hi> thing to bee <hi>Religious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>name</hi> indeed of <hi>Religion</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſerves their turn (as when they live in places where it brings in gain or credit) and then they make a <hi>profeſſion;</hi> but the thing it ſelf they abominate, as being the greateſt <hi>let</hi> and <hi>hindrance</hi> to that wicked,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170316:117"/>worldly deſigne of theirs, which under that profeſſion they mainly proſecute. But where a profeſſion is not of any ſuch uſe and advantage, they abandon that too, and ſo become either <hi>notoriouſly prophane and diſſolute,</hi> or at beſt but
<hi>civilly honeſt.</hi> And thus they continue untill ſuch time as their eyes bee opened to ſee into the emptineſs and vanity of all things here below, the word of God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no effectual operation upon them before; for while they imagine their onely happineſs is to bee found here, they will neither bee, nor do what is neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in order to their finding it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. It is a good ſigne of a mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and turning to God, when his judgement is rectified concerning theſe things, that whereas before hee thought his chiefeſt good to bee in them, hee now looks upon them as altogether deſtitute of it, and therefore muſt have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better than the beſt of them to make him really happy, as wee ſee in
<hi>Solomon</hi> after his recovery from his fall, who could then ſay, <hi>Vanity of vanities, Vanity of vanities, all is vanity,</hi> Eccleſ. 1.2. And in <hi>Paul</hi> after his converſion, who tells the <hi>Philippians</hi> that hee <hi>counted all things but loſs for the excellency of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Jeſus his Lord, for whom hee had ſuffered the loſs of all things, and did count them but dung, that hee might win
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:170316:117"/>Chriſt, and bee found in him,</hi> Phil. 3.8, 9. Such a light is ſet up in the ſoul at its firſt converſion, as diſcovers unto it the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of thoſe things that are ſpiritual and eternal, in compariſon of which, all the outward glittering glory of
<hi>temporal things</hi> is darkned, ſo that it ſees no glory in them by reaſon of the glory that doth excel. And yet ſometimes it is apt to bee miſled by thoſe falſe repreſentations of theſe things, that <hi>fancy</hi> and <hi>imagination</hi> not well governed, now and then gives of them, upon a ſhallow apprehenſion of a greater good in them than indeed there is, taken from the ſenſes. Theſe things are ſuitable unto the ſenſes, and <hi>Self</hi> (a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder whereof is in the <hi>beſt</hi>) earneſtly contends that what teſtimony they give of them may bee accepted.

The next is,</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>That Affection that Self bears to them. Set your affection on things above, and not on things on the earth,</hi> Col. 3.2. <hi>For the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation, hath
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:170316:118"/>appeared to all men, teaching us to deny un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs, and worldly luſts,</hi> Tit. 2.11, 12. In particular,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 That love that Self bears to them: Self judging them to bee the chiefeſt good (as wee ſhewed in the former particular) loves them as the chiefeſt good. Love is the immediate iſſue and natural product of the judgement; no ſooner doth the judgement conceive any thing to bee good, but a childe of love is born pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and ſucks the breaſts. If men judge this or that to bee good, they cannot chooſe but bee in love with it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the degrees of goodneſs, that they diſcover in the object, are the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of love that they bear unto the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. If it bee goodneſs apprehended in a remiſs degree, the love is but a remiſs love, if in an intenſe degree, the love is intenſe, if they apprehend it to bee all in all, they love it with all their hearts; the underſtanding makes the primary diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the object, the judgement deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines concerning the goodneſs of it, and the will takes it upon truſt from the judgement.</p>
                  <p>Now it matters not whether it bee a real good or not, if it do but appear to bee ſo to the judgement, that is enough to draw the will after it. <hi>If I bee lifted up</hi> (ſaith Chriſt)
<hi>I will draw all men unto mee;</hi> if I bee lifted up on the Croſs, lifted up
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:170316:118"/>from the Grave, lifted up from earth to Heaven, but eſpecially if I bee lifted up in mens judgements, if they once lift mee up above themſelves, above all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things, ſo as to give me the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, ſo as to make me all in all in order to the obtaining of the chief good. So it is with the World, if it bee lifted up in drawes all men unto it; if the Devil once carry up the glory of the World to an exceeding high Mountaine and ſhew it from thence, it drawes all men unto it. This effect it had upon <hi>David,</hi> when hee judged his worldly eſtate to bee a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, when hee lookt upon it as a moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine exceeding high and ſtrong; when the world, and the glory thereof appears as a mountaine lifted up above all, that men cannot look beyond it, then it draws their affection up unto it.</p>
                  <p>Love is of the nature of Fire, which is no ſooner kindled but it ſoares upwards ſpeedily, conſtantly, becauſe its element is above; ſo it is with this affection of love, which is no ſooner inkindled in the Soul, but the ſparks thereof flye upwards to that appearance of good which is above. It is true, theſe things that men vent their love upon, are things upon the earth, and oppoſed, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. to the things that are above, and to are really below; but though they bee really <hi>below,</hi> yet they are ſeemingly <hi>above,</hi> becauſe the judgement
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170316:119"/>looking round about on every ſide, can ſee nothing above them, and therefore concludes they are the ſupreame good; as you know it is with Children, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome Mountaines ſeeme to touch the Sky, conclude therefore that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beyond thoſe Mountaines; ſo it is with worldly men, who becauſe they can ſee nothing beyond or above their moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of worldly enjoyments, doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude that there are no better things, and conſequently terminate their love upon them; there muſt of neceſſity therefore bee a change of the judgement that this affection bee not miſ-placed. The miſ-placing of this affection upon a wrong object is of a more hainous nature, and dangerous conſequence than ordinarily is imagined.</p>
                  <p>Men make nothing of loving the world, they think it no way inconſiſtent with love to God. But what ſaith the Scripture? <hi>Love not the world, nor the things of the world, if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.15. <hi>Yee adulterers, and adultereſſes, know yee not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity with God? Whoſoever therefore will bee a friend of the world, is the enemy of God,</hi> Jam. 4.4. Thus the Scripture ſpeakes in the general. In particular, concerning the love of riches, <hi>No ſervant can ſerve two Masters, for either hee will hate the one, and love the
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170316:119"/>other; or elſe hee will hold to the one, and deſpiſe the other, yee cannot ſerve God and Mammon,</hi> Luke 16.14. <hi>The love of mony is the root of all evil,</hi>

<q>I knew a man my ſelf, <hi>Bilney,</hi> little <hi>Bilney,</hi> that bleſſed Martyr of God, who what time he had borne his Faggot, and was come againe to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> had ſuch Conflicts within himſelf, that his friends were afraid to let him be alone, they were faine to be with him day and night, and comfort him as they could, but no comforts would ſerve; and as for comfortable places of Scripture, to bring them unto him, it was as though a man ſhould cut him thorow the heart with a ſword.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in another Sermon preached in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> he hath theſe words concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it;
<q>That ſame Mr. <hi>Bilney,</hi> who was burnt here in <hi>England</hi> for Gods Words ſake, was induced and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his Friends to bear a Faggot at the time when the <hi>Cardinal</hi> was aloft, and bare the ſwinge; now when the ſame <hi>Bilney</hi> came to <hi>Cambridge</hi> againe, a whole year after, hee was in ſuch an anguiſh and agony, that nothing did him good, neither eating nor drinking, nor any other communication of Gods Word, for hee thought that all the whole Scriptures were againſt him, and ſounded to his Condemnation, ſo that
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170316:125"/>I many a time communed with him, (for I was familiarly acquainted with him) but all things whatſoever any man could alledge to his comfort, ſeemed unto him to make againſt him.</q>

                     <q>If I ſhould not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine returne unto the truth (having the New Teſtament in his hand) this Word of God would damne mee both Body and Soule at the Day of Judgement. <hi>And there he prayed every</hi> body rather to dye by and by, than to doe as hee did, for hee would not feele ſuch an hell againe as he did feele, for all the worlds good.</q>

                     <pb n="200" facs="tcp:170316:126"/>Thus ſeverely did God chaſtiſe theſe two good men for a time, ſhewing them what Hell meant by ſome few ſcalding drops of his immediate Wrath let fall upon their Conſciences, thereby making them throughly ſenſible of the deſert of their moſt horrible Sin, in renouncing his moſt bleſſed Truth; to the undaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and conſtant profeſſion whereof, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding out of the ſuperabounding riches of his grace, hee recovered them againe, ſo that moſt reſolutely and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully afterwards they ſealed it with their bloud.</p>
                  <p>But it hapned otherwiſe to that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleld example of Divine Juſtice, <hi>Francis Spira,</hi> who after his Abjuration being ſuddainly <hi>Thunder-ſtruck</hi> with the terrible and amazing <hi>Sentence</hi> of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Condemnation, was plunged irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably (for ought that appeared to the contrary) into the bottomleſs gulph of <hi>Deſpair.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This wretched man being accuſed to the Popes Legate, for profeſſing and teaching ſome of
<hi>Luthers</hi> opinions, <hi>this</hi> eſpecially, <hi>That wee muſt only depend on the Free Grace, and unchangeable love of God in the death of Chriſt, as the only ſure way of Salvation;</hi> and being ſummoned to appear before him; after ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had of the manifold danger hee was in, and reſolution taken up to ſtand to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170316:126"/>his profeſſion, and to maintaine his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, notwithſtanding hee began to think with himſelf what miſery this his raſhneſſe would bring him unto, that he ſhould loſe his ſubſtance gotten with ſo much care and travell, undergoe the moſt exquiſite torments that malice it ſelf could deviſe, be counted an Heretick of all, and in the concluſion dye ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon he goes to the Legate, and acknowledgeth his fault, in entertaining an Opinion concerning ſome Articles of Faith, contrary to the Orthodox and received Judgement of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> profeſſing his hearty ſorrow for it, and humbly begging pardon for ſo great an offence. The Legate perceiving him to faint, purſued him to the uttermoſt, cauſed him to ſubſcribe this Confeſſion, and made him promiſe that at his returne to his owne Towne hee would declare it to the people, acknowledge the whole Doctrine of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the Opinions of <hi>Luther</hi> as falſe and Heretical. <hi>Spira</hi> having promiſed in this manner, forth-with addreſſeth himſelf for his journey homeward, but as he went along, thinking with himſelf, how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly hee had denyed Chriſt and his Goſpel at <hi>Venice,</hi> and engaged himſelf to doe it the ſecond time in his owne Country, hee thought hee heard a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170316:127"/>voyce ſpeaking unto him in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>Spira,
<q>
                        <hi>What doſt thou here? whether goeft thou? haſt thou unhappy man, given thy hand-writing to the Legate at</hi> Venice? <hi>yet ſee thou doſt not ſeal it in thine owne Country; thou canſt not anſwer for what thou haſt already done, nevertheleſs the gate of Mercy is not quite ſhut, take heed that thou heapeſt not ſin upon ſin, leſt thou repent when it will be too late.</hi>
                     </q> This filled him ſo full of doubts and perplexing thoughts, that hee knew not which way to turne, nor what to doe; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being arrived in his owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and adviſed by his friends, telling him,
<q>
                        <hi>That it was requiſite he ſhould take heed that he did not in any wiſe betray his Wife and Children, and all his friends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to danger, ſeeing that by ſo ſmall a matter as the recitiug of a ſmall Schedule, which might be done in leſſe ſpace than half an hour, he might both free himſelf from preſent danger, and preſerve many that depended on him;</hi>
                     </q> he goes to the <hi>Praetor,</hi> and proffers to performe his fore-ſaid promiſe made to the Legate, and the next morning hee deſperately enters into the publick Congregation, where
<hi>Maſſe</hi> being finiſhed, in the preſence of friends and enemies, and of the whole Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, yea and of Heaven it ſelfe, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites that infamous Abjuration, word for
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170316:127"/>word as it was written; then was hee ſent home reſtored to his<note n="e" place="margin">Hee was a Civil Lawyer, an Advocate of great rank and eſteeme, endowed with outward bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of Wife, and eleven Children, and wealth in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance.</note> Dignities, Goods, Wife, and Children; but no ſooner was he departed, but he thought he heard a direful voyce, ſaying to him,
<q>
                        <hi>Thou wicked wretch, thou haſt denied mee, thou haſt renounced the covenant of thy obedience. thou baſt broken thy vow; hence Apoſtate, bear with thee the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of thy eternal Damnation.</hi>
                     </q> Hee trembling and quaking in body and mind fell downe in a ſwoon, and from that time forward never found any peace, or eaſe of his mind, but continuing in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant torments, hee profeſſed that hee was captivated under the revenging hand of the great God, and that hee heard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually that fearful Sentence of Chriſt, that juſt Judge, and was utterly undone. Phiſicians were ſent for, but they could effect nothing by their skill upon him, and therefore after they had underſtood the whole truth of the matter, wiſhed him to ſeek ſome Spiritual comfort. They that came to adminiſter Spiritual comfort to him, propounded many of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes recorded in the Scripture, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples of Gods mercy; but
<q>
                        <hi>My Sin</hi> (ſaid hee) <hi>is greater than the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God.</hi>
                     </q> They told him: that God would have all men to be ſaved; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<q>
                        <hi>He would not have damned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates to bee ſaved, I am one of that
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170316:128"/>number, I know it, for I willingly and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my knowledge denied Chriſt, the Mercy of God extends not to me, nor any like to me, who are ſealed up to Wrath, I tell you I deſerve it, my owne Conſcience condemnes mee, what needeth any other Judge?</hi>
                     </q> Some bade him conſider the example of <hi>Peter,</hi> who denied Chriſt thrice, and with an Oath, and yet Chriſt was merciful to him. Hee anſwered,
<q>
                        <hi>In that he was pardoned, it was not becauſe he wept, but becauſe God was gracious to him; but God reſpects not mee, and therefore I am a reprobate, no comfort can enter into my heart, there is no place there but only for torments, and vexings of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; I tell you, my caſe is properly my owne, no man ever was in like plight, and therefore my eſtate is fearful.</hi>
                     </q> Then roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring out in the bitterneſs of his ſpirit, he ſaid,
<q>
                        <hi>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi>
                     </q> Some whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſaid, that hee was poſſeſſed, which he over-hearing it, ſaid,
<q>
                        <hi>Doe you doubt it? I have a whole Legion of Devils that take up their dwellings within mee, and poſſeſſe me as their owne, and that justly too, for I have denied Chriſt.</hi>
                     </q> Whether did you that willingly or no? (ſaid they)
<q>
                        <hi>That is nothing to the purpoſe (ſaid hee) Chriſt ſaith, Whoſoever denies me before men, him will I deny before my Father which is in Heaven;</hi> Chriſt will not bee
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170316:128"/>denied, no not in word, <hi>and therefore it is enough, though in heart I never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied him.</hi>
                     </q> They asked him, whether he thought there were worſe paines than what hee endured for the preſent? hee ſaid,
<q>
                        <hi>That he knew there were farre worſe paines, for the wicked ſhall riſe to their Judgement, but they ſhall not ſtand in Judgement; this I tremble to think of, yet I deſire nothing more than that I might come to that place, where I may be ſure to feele the worſt, and bee freed from fear of worſe to come.</hi>
                     </q> Why doe you, (ſaid they) eſteeme this ſo grievous a ſin, when as the learned Legate conſtrained you to it, which hee ſurely would not have done, if your former opinions had not been erroneous? Hee anſwered,
<q>
                        <hi>All thoſe many ſins that in the former part of my life I committed, then did not ſo much trouble me, for I truſted that God would not lay them to my charge, but now having ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt, God brings all my ſins to remembrance, and thus guilty of one, guilty of all; and therefore it is no matter whether my ſins be great or ſmall, they are ſuch, as Chriſts Bloud, nor Gods Mercy belongs to mee.</hi> God will have mercy on whom hee will have mercy, and whom he will he hardneth; <hi>this is it that gnaws my heart, he hath hardned me, and I finde that hee daily more and more doth harden me, and therefore I am
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170316:129"/>out of hope; I feele it, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but deſpair. I tell you, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch a Monſter as I am — I knew that Juſtification is to be expected by Chriſt, and I denied and abjured it, to the end I might keep this fraile life from adverſity, and my Children from poverty, and now behold how bitter this life is to me! and God only knowes what ſhall become of this my Family, but ſurely no good is likely to betide it, but rather daily worſe and worſe, and ſuch a ruine at length, as that one ſtone ſhall not be left on another.</hi>
                     </q> But why ſhould you (ſaid<note n="f" place="margin">A Doctor that came to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him.</note> 
                     <hi>Gribaldus</hi>) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit ſo deeply of your ſin, ſeeing you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but know that many have denied Chriſt, and yet never fell into deſpair?
<q>
                        <hi>Well</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I can ſee no ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for ſuch, neither can I warrant them from Gods revenging hand in Wrath, though it pleaſeth God yet to ſuffer ſuch to be in peace; and beſides, there will a time of change come, and then they ſhall be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly tried, and if it were not ſo: yet God is juſt, in making mee an example to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers — I aſſure you, it is no ſmall matter to deny Chriſt, and yet it is more ordinary than commonly men doe conceive of — as often as a Chriſtian doth diſſemble the knowne truth, as often as he approves of falſe worſhip, by preſenting himſelf at it, ſo often as he doth not things worthy of his calling, or ſuch things as are unworthy of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170316:129"/>his calling, ſo often he denies Chriſt; thus did I, and therefore am juſtly puniſhed for it.</hi>
                     </q> Some time after this, came in two Biſhops, one of them being
<hi>Paulus Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerius,</hi> deſired him to pray with him the Lords Prayer; <hi>Spira</hi> conſented, and went on with ſome enlargement upon ſeveral Petitions, to whom when hee had done they ſaid, You know that none can call Chriſt Jeſus the Lord but by the Holy Ghoſt;
<q>
                        <hi>I perceive (replied he) that I call on him to my eternal Damnation.</hi>
                     </q> They told him, he was in a ſpiritual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, and therefore ſhould not beleeve what Sathan ſuggeſted to him, but thoſe rather whom hee judged to bee in a good eſtate, and more able to diſcerne of him than himſelf; beleeve us (ſaid they) we tell you that God will bee merciful to you.
<q>
                        <hi>O here is the knot, ſaid he, I would I could beleeve, but I cannot.</hi>
                     </q> Then hee began to reckon up what fearful Dreames and Viſions he was continually troubled withall, that hee ſaw the Devils come flocking into his Chamber, and about his Bed, terrifying him with ſtrange Noiſes, that theſe were not Fancies, but he ſaw them as really as the ſtanders by; and that beſides theſe, hee felt continually a racking torture of his mind, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual butchery of his Conſcience, being the very proper pangs of the Damned wights in Hell —
<q>
                        <hi>Deſperation it ſelf
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170316:130"/>continually tortures me, and now I count my preſent eſtate worſe than if my Soul, (ſeparated from my body) were with</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, <hi>and the reſt of the Damned; and therefore I now deſire rather to bee there, than thus to live in the body.</hi>
                     </q> After this againe, one told him, that hee was not to beleeve himſelf, but rather him that was in a good eſtate; and I teſtifie to you, (ſaid hee) that God will bee merciful to you;
<q>
                        <hi>Nay (anſwered he) for becauſe I am in this ill eſtate, therefore can I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve nothing but what is contrary to my Salvation and comfort. But you that are ſo confident of your good eſtate, look that it be true, for it is no ſuch ſmall matter to bee aſſured of ſincerity. A man had need be exceeding ſtrongly grounded in the truth, before hee can bee able to affirme ſuch a matter as you now doe; it is not the performance of a few outward duties, but a mighty conſtant labour, with all intention of heart and affection, with full deſire and endeavour</hi> continually to ſet forth Gods glory; there muſt bee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fear of Legats, Inquiſitors, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, nor any Death whatſoever. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny think themſelves happy that are not, it is not every one that ſaith, Lord, Lord, that ſhall goe to Heaven.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>One that came to ſee him, told him, that he had been with him at <hi>Venice</hi> ſome eight weekes before.
<q>
                        <hi>O curſed day!
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170316:130"/>(ſaid</hi> Spira) <hi>O curſed day! O that I had never gone thither, would God I had then dyed.</hi>
                     </q> Afterwards came in a Prieſt, bringing with him a Book of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſmes to Conjure the Devil out of him; whom when <hi>Spira</hi> ſaw, ſhaking his head, he ſaid,
<q>
                        <hi>I am verily perſwaded indeed, that God hath left me to the power of the Devils, but ſuch they are as are not to be found in your Letany.</hi>
                     </q> To <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerius</hi> by many Arguments, exhorting him to beleeve.
<q>
                        <hi>Belike (ſaid hee) you think I delight in this eſtate, if I could conceive but the leaſt ſpark of hope of a better eſtate hereafter, I would not refuſe to endure the moſt heavie weight of the Wrath of that great God, yea for twenty thouſand years, ſo that I might at length attaine to the end of that miſery which I now know will bee eternal; but I tell you, my will is wounded.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee exhorted the company that were preſent, in this manner;
<q>
                        <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, it is no light or eaſie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be a Chriſtian, it is not Baptiſme, or reading of the Scriptures, or boaſting of faith in Christ (though even theſe are good) that can prove one to be an abſolute Chriſtian. You know what I ſaid before,</hi> there muſt bee a conformity in Life, a Chriſtian muſt bee ſtrong, unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>not</hi> carrying an obſcure profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but reſolute in expreſſing the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170316:131"/>Image of Chriſt, and holding out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all oppoſition to the laſt breath — <hi>Many there are that ſnatch at the Promiſes in the Goſpel, as if they did undoubtedly belong to them, and yet they</hi> remaine ſluggiſh <hi>and careleſſe, and being flattered by the things of this preſent World, they paſſe on their courſe in quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſecurity, as if they were the only happy men, whom nevertheleſſe the Lord in his providence hath ordained to eternal Wrath, as you may ſee in Saint</hi> Lukes <hi>rich man; thus it was with me, therefore take heed.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He diſdainfully refuſing ſome meat that was brought him by one of his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews, the young man charged him with hypocriſie and diſſimulation, to whom hee replied —
<q>
                        <hi>I am a caſt away, a Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of Wrath, yet dare you call it diſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and phrenſie, and can mock at the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable example of the heavie Wrath of God, that ſhould teach you fear and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour? But it is natural to the fleſh, either out of malice or ignorance to ſpeak perverſly of the works of God;</hi> The Natural man diſcerneth not the things of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>One of his familiar friends chanced to ſay, that certainly he was overcome with Melancholly, which hee over-hearing, anſwered;
<q>
                        <hi>Well, be it ſo, ſeeing you will needs have it ſo, for thus alſo is Gods
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170316:131"/>wrath manifeſted againſt mee — you ſee Brethren what a dangerous thing it is to ſtop or ſtay in things that concern Gods glory, eſpecially to diſſemble upon any termes, what a fearful thing is it to bee near, and almoſt a Chriſtian! Never was the like example to this of mine, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you bee wiſe you will ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereof. O that God would let looſe his hand from me, that it were with me now as in times paſt!</hi> I would ſcorne the threats of the moſt cruel Tyrants, bear Torments with invincible reſolution, and glory in the outward profeſſion of Chriſt till I were choaked in the flame, and my body conſumed to aſhes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now</hi> ſeemed to bee verified upon him, that whereof in the beginning hee had been ſo ſeaſonably fore-warned, that if hee proceeded to fulfill his wicked pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Abjuring in his owne Country, hee might haply repent too late. <hi>Now,</hi> if God would with-draw his hand from him, if it might be with him as in former dayes, hee would doe and ſuffer any thing for-Chriſt; but upon no termes might his wiſh bee granted, all hope of mercy was quite cut off from him; ſo that afterwards (his purpoſe of miſchieving himſelf by a Knife that hee had haſtily ſnatched up, being by his Friends pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented) with indignation hee cryed out,
<q>
                        <hi>I would I were above God, for I know hee

<hi>doth a living man complaine, a man for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſins?</hi> Lam. 3.39. <hi>It is of the Lords mercies that wee are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions faile not,</hi> verſ. 22. if he ſhould deale with us according to our deſervings, hee might juſtly caſt us into Hell.</p>
                  <p>Were wee but throughly convinced of this, had wee but once the real ſence and feeling of it in our ſelves, there would bee no ſuch anguiſh and vexation in any of our ſufferings here, as many times we

The Croſſe is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry irkſome and tedious to the fleſh, and therefore as it is unwilling to come under it, ſo it is unwilling to continue under it; but as wee muſt willingly take it up, ſo wee muſt patiently bear it; as wee muſt not refuſe it when Chriſt will lay it on, ſo wee muſt not reject it till Chriſt will take it off. It is lawful to uſe means to free our ſelves of our troubles, but all means are not lawful to bee uſed.

                  <head>SVBSECT. <hi>VI.</hi> Of denying Self in reſpect of our Relations.</head>
                  <p>THis is the laſt particular to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, and I ſhall diſpatch it in a word.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Negatively, it is not meant that wee ſhould deny the workings of Natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards them. God requires that wee ſhould love all men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8, 9. even our very enemies, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.32.—35. and that wee ſhould expreſs our love by doing good to all men, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. even to our enemies, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.20. now if wee bee thus bound to <hi>all,</hi> much
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170316:136"/>more therefore to <hi>ſome;</hi> if thus to our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, much more therefore to our friends, to our kindred, to thoſe of our owne family. Wee are ſome way related to all men, in as much as wee are all of one bloud, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.26. and therefore we muſt love all, and doe good unto all; but there are ſome to whom wee are more eſpecially related, and thoſe wee muſt love with a more eſpecial love; the nearer the relation, the dearer the love, and the more endearing muſt the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of it be. And in this ſenſe that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular precept to Husbands of loving their Wives, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.28. and to Wives of loving their Husbands, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.4. muſt bee underſtood. <hi>To be without natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> is made a note of the fouleſt wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, not only in the Gentiles,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. but alſo in the profeſſors of the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3. of whom the Apoſtle ſaith, that if any provide not for his owne, and ſpecially for thoſe of his owne houſe, hee hath denied the faith, and is worſe than an Infidel, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.8. The Phariſees taught the people (even as the Papiſts doe at this day) that if any one Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated his eſtate to God, he was exempted from his duty of releeving his poor Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; if hee could ſay to his Father, or Mother, <hi>It is Corban, that is to ſay a gift, by whatſoever thou mighteſt bee profited by mee, then hee ſhould bee free, and they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170316:137"/>him no more to doe ought for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or his Mother.</hi> But our Saviour ſharply reproved them for it, telling them, that <hi>they rejected the Commandement of God, that they might keep their owne tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Mar. 7.9. and that <hi>they made the Word of God of none effect through their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which they had delivered,</hi> verſ. 13. therefore that muſt be warily underſtood, which hee elſewhere ſaith, <hi>If any man come to mee, and hate not his Father, and Mother, and Wife, and Children, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and Siſters, hee cannot be my Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> Luke 14.26. Wee ſee it cannot bee underſtood abſolutely (Chriſt means not ſo) but only in ſome certaine reſpect, when our love to them, and our love to Chriſt are
<hi>incompatible,</hi> I ſhall thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine it; Wee are to hate Father and Mother, Wife and Children, Brethren and Siſters, as wee are to hate other men. We are not to hate them abſolutely, ſo as in no reſpect to bear any love unto them, for we are commanded to love them, and to doe good unto them, even the worſt of them, as I have ſhewed above; but in ſome certaine reſpect, as they are enemies to God, and to our ſerving of God; ſo we not only may, but wee ought to hate them, and in this reſpect <hi>David</hi> pleads it unto God as an argument of his ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; <hi>Doe not I hate them O Lord that hate thee, and am not I grieved with thoſe that
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170316:137"/>riſe up againſt thee? I hate them with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect hatred, I count them mine enemies.</hi> Now what follows? <hi>Search me, O God, and know my heart; try mee, and know my thoughts,</hi> Pſal. 139.21, 22, 23. in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect wee are to hate our neareſt relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and it is a ſpecial evidence of true love to Chriſt ſo to doe. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Affirmatively, to deny Self in reſpect of our Relations is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1 <hi>Not</hi> to connive at them in any way of ſin, if wee be Superiours.

<hi>Behold, I will doe a thing in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>at which both the cares of every one that heareth it ſhall tingle; in that day I will performe againſt</hi> Eli <hi>all things which I have ſpoken concerning his houſe; when I begin I will alſo make an end, for I have told him that I will judge his houſe for ever, for the iniquity which hee knoweth; becauſe his Sons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not.

But ſuppoſe hee had been but a private perſon, and ſo not

                  <p>And this God ſtill requires of all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, that when by admonition and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof they can prevaile nothing upon their Children, they ſhould try what may bee done by correction.
<hi>Chaſten thy Son while there is hope, and let not thy ſoul spare for his crying,</hi> Prov.

By theſe Scriptures it appears, that correction is an Ordinance of God, and a means by him appointed, not only in order to the credit and quiet of the Parent, but the Salvation of the Child alſo, and therefore cannot be neglected without manifeſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his eternal Damnation. Now, what Parent that has any bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in him, can endure to think that through any neglect of his, his Childe ſhould bee caſt into Hell? It pitties ſome to hear their Children crying here, but how will they endure to hear them roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Hell-fire hereafter? How will they endure to hear them curſing them at the Day of Judgement, and crying for vengeance upon them, for not reſtraining them from thoſe ſinful Courſes that brought them to ſo great a miſery?

            <p>HAving ſhewn what Self-denial is in the general, and what it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>Inherent grace, Common gifts, Good works, Worldly enjoyments, Worldly ſuffrings,</hi> and our
<hi>Relations</hi> in particular; I come now to demonſtrate the <hi>neceſsity</hi> of it, and for this I ſhall need doe no more, but ſhew the <hi>impoſsibility of coming after Chriſt without it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. If</hi> it bee impoſſible for any one without Self-denial <hi>to come after Chriſt,</hi> then whoſoever will come after Chriſt, muſt of neceſſity deny himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> it is impoſſible for any one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Self-denial to <hi>come after Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore</hi> whoſoever will come after Chriſt, muſt of neceſſity deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To come after Chriſt</hi> (as I have expreſt
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170316:142"/>it in the Doctrine) is to come after him in the way of holineſs unto eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Now, that it is impoſſible for any one without Self-denial to come after Chriſt in the way of holineſs unto eternal happineſs, will manifeſtly appear in the proof of theſe two particulars follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="1">1 That it is impoſſible for any one to come after Chriſt unto eternal happineſs, without coming after him in the way of holineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2 That it is impoſſible for any one to come after Chriſt in the way of holineſs, without denying himſelf.</p>
            <p>For the firſt of theſe, <hi>That it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for any one to come after Chriſt unto eternal happines, without coming after him in the way of holineſs,</hi> I prove it by theſe three Arguments,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. <hi>If</hi> it be impoſſible for any one without coming after Chriſt in the way of holineſs <hi>to enter into the kingdom of God,</hi> then it is impoſsible for any one without coming after Chriſt in the way of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to come after him to eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> it is impoſsible for any one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coming after Chriſt in the way of holineſs, <hi>to enter into the kingdome of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore,</hi> it is impoſsible for any one without coming after Chriſt in the way of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170316:142"/>holineſs, to come after him to eternal happineſs.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> here, is meant the <hi>Kingdome of glory,</hi> Mar. 10.37. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.21. <hi>into</hi> which Chriſt himſelf is entred, 1
<hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. and <hi>unto</hi> which he brings all thoſe whom he brings to eternal happineſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. and <hi>out</hi> of which it is certaine there is no happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as is evident, <hi>Mar.</hi> 9.47. where <hi>to enter into the Kingdome of God</hi> is all one with
<hi>entring into life,</hi> verſ. 45. and that which is oppoſed unto it is, <hi>To be caſt into Hell, where their worme dyeth not, and the fire is not quenched,</hi> verſ. 48.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> then is undeniable, the <hi>Aſſumption</hi> is proved by theſe Scriptures, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Kingdome of God as a little childe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mark 10.15</note> 
               <hi>he ſhall not enter therein. No man having put his hand to the Plough, and looking back is fit for the Kingdome of God,</hi> Luke 9.62.
<hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto thee, except a man be borne againe, he cannot ſee the Kingdome of God,</hi> John 3.3. <hi>Except a man bee borne of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdome of God,</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>Know yee not, that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of God? Bee not deceived, neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with man kind, nor Theeves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:170316:143"/>nor Extortioners, ſhall inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.9, 10.
<hi>Now the works of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are theſe, Adultery, Fornication, Vncleaneneſs, Laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſneſs, Idolatry, Witch-craft, Hatred, Variance, Emulations, Wrath, Strife, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, Hereſies, Envyings, Murders, Drunkenneſs, Revellings, and ſuch like; of the which I tell you before, as I have alſo told you in time paſt, that they which doe ſuch things ſhall not enherit the Kingdome of God,</hi> Galath. 5.19, 20, 21. <hi>For this you know, that no Whoremonger, nor uncleane perſon, nor covetous man who is an Idolater, hath any inheritance in the Kingdome of Chriſt, and of God,</hi> Epheſ. 5.5. <hi>Bleſſed are they that doe his Commandements, that they may have right to the Tree of Life, and may enter in thorow the gates into the City, for without are Doggs, and Sorcerers, and Whoremongers, and Murderers, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a lye,</hi> Revel. 22.14, 15. See <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.19,
20. and chap. 7.21. and the Parable of the ten Virgins, chap. 25.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. <hi>If</hi> it bee impoſsible for any one without coming after Chriſt in the way of holineſs <hi>to ſee God,</hi> then it is impoſsible for any one without coming after Chriſt in the way of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to come after him to eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> it is impoſsible for any one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:170316:143"/>coming after Chriſt in the way of holineſs <hi>to ſee God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore</hi> it is impoſsible for any one without coming after Chriſt in the way of holineſs, to come after him to eternal happineſs.</p>
            <p>The happineſs of the Kingdome of Glory conſiſts in <hi>ſeeing of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.12.
1 John 3.2. therefore <hi>Chriſt</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth of the <hi>pure in heart,</hi> that they are
<hi>bleſſed,</hi> for this reaſon, becauſe <hi>they ſhall ſee God,</hi> Matth. 5.8. therefore the <hi>impure,</hi> that is, ſuch as live and dye without holineſs, muſt needs bee
<hi>curſed,</hi> for they ſhall never ſee God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Follow pence with all men, and holineſſe, without which no man ſhall ſee the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. <hi>If</hi> it be impoſsible for any one without coming after Chriſt in the way of holineſs, <hi>to eſcape eternal Damnation in Hell fire,</hi> then it is impoſsible for any one without coming after Chriſt in the way of holineſs, to come after him to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> it is impoſsible for any one, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coming after Chriſt in the way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, <hi>to eſcape eternal Damnation in Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore</hi> it is impoſsible for any one, without coming after Chriſt in the way of holineſs, to come after him to eternal happineſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> none will deny that
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:170316:144"/>underſtands, and beleeves what eternal Damnation in Hell-fire is; the
<hi>Second part</hi> is proved by theſe teſtimonies of Scripture, <hi>The Son of man ſhall ſend forth his Angels, and they ſhall gather out of his Kingdome all things that offend, and them which doe iniquity; and ſhall caſt them into a furnace of fire, there ſhall be wayling and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> Matth. 13.41, 42. <hi>Yee Serpents, yee generation of Vipers, how can yee eſcape the Damnation of Hell?</hi> Chap. 23.33. <hi>Then ſhall hee alſo ſay unto them on the left hand, Depart from mee yee curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> chap. 25.41. —<hi>Whoſe fan is in his hand, and hee will thorowly purge his floore, and will gather the Wheat into his Garner, but the Chaffe hee will burne with fire unquenchable,</hi> Luke 3.17. <hi>The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves ſhall hear his voyce, and ſhall come forth, they that have done good unto the reſurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the reſurrection of damnation,</hi> John 5.28, 29.
<hi>Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you — When the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſhall bee revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall bee puniſhed with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction from the preſence of the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170316:144"/>Lord, and from the glory of his power,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.6, 7, 8, 9.
<hi>Even as</hi> Sodome <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah, <hi>and the Cities about them, in like manner giving themſelves over to fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh, are ſet forth for an example, ſuffering the vengeance of eternal fire,</hi> Epiſt. of Jude, verſ. 7. <hi>But the fearful, and unbeleeving, and the abominable, and Murderers, and Whoremongers, and Sorcerers, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, and Lyars, ſhall have their part in the Lake which burneth with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which is the Second Death,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel. 21.8.</p>
            <p>Thus I have proved the firſt Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>That it is impoſſible for any one to come after Chriſt to eternal happineſſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coming after him in the way of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second, <hi>That it is impoſsible for any one to come after Chriſt in the way of holineſſe, without denying himſelf,</hi> I prove thus.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg. If</hi> it bee impoſſible for any one to come after Chriſt in the way of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without denying one, <hi>that will never conſent that hee ſhould walk in the way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe: but (if hee be not denied) will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly lead him into the way of ſin;</hi> then it is impoſſible for any one to come after Chriſt in the way of holineſſe without denying himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> it is impoſſible for any one to come
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170316:145"/>after Chriſt in the way of holineſſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out denying one, <hi>that will never conſent that he ſhould walk in the way of holineſſe, but (if he be not denied) will certainly lead him into the way of ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it is impoſſible for any one to come after Chriſt in the way of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs without denying himſelf.</p>
            <p>The reaſon of the <hi>Conſequence</hi> is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Self</hi> will never conſent that any one ſhould walk in the way of holineſs.

                     <head>The Fifth excellency of Self-denial.</head>
                     <p n="5">5 It is a Chriſtians <hi>peace and tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi> None have more real comfort and contentment in their ſpirits, than thoſe who doe moſt conſcientiouſly deny themſelves; this muſt needs be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a ſpecial argument of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Self-denial. There is nothing that the heart of man is more ſet upon than pleaſure and contentment, and there is nothing that doth more deterre men from this duty of Self-denial, than a fear that they ſhall not enjoy that ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory pleaſure and contentment in the practice of it, that they doe for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, while they <hi>have their conver ſation in the luſts of their fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh, and of the mind</hi> (Epheſ. 2.3.) for the accompliſhment of their own baſe ends. And therefore it is of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for the making you in love with this duty, that you bee thorowly convinced of the real joy and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſatisfaction and eaſe that is to bee found in it, it may haply ſound as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox, but there is a real truth in it, <hi>That the only way for a man to enjoy himſelf, is to deny himſelf;</hi> then (weſay) a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes himſelf, when he takes comfort and
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:170316:168"/>delight in all that he hath, and all that he doth; a man deſtitute of comfort and contentment, that can take no delight in any thing, we ſay of ſuch a man, that he doth not enjoy himſelf; why, in this ſenſe Self-denial gives a man the ſweeteſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of himſelf of any thing in the world. <hi>In your patience</hi> (ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our)
<hi>poſſeſſe yee your ſouls,</hi> Luke 21.19. there is much Self-denial exerciſed in patience, now this is preſcribed as a means to keep poſſeſſion of our Souls, exerciſe patience, and you will bee able to keep poſſeſſion; What is that? why to keep your Souls in order, and under your command, for then a man hath the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion when all is in his power, and at his diſpoſal; it is not barely the being in his houſe, but the having it in his owne power, for a man may bee a Priſoner in his owne houſe; ſo then, to poſſeſſe our Souls, is to bee able <hi>to keep the peace in them,</hi> to keep them in ſuch order that wee can maintaine a ſweet calme, and quiet frame and temper in them, that they be not turned out of doores by any boyſterous and unruly paſſions, and this is done by Self-denial, and cannot bee done without it.</p>
                     <p>A ſelfiſh man is beſides himſelf, though he ſeek himſelf in every thing, yet he doth not find himſelf in any thing, he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed of himſelf, being either carried
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170316:168"/>away captive by his wandring deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſomething that hee wants, or kept cloſe priſoner by his cares and feares of ſomething that he hath; he hath no real peace at all within himſelf, no ſolid joy and contentment in his life.</p>
                     <p>Obj. <hi>You will ſay, that cannot be ſo, for we obſerve that none doe live more merry lives, none are ſo jocund and merry as ſuch men, and that it is not poſſible the life of Self-denial ſhould yeeld half ſo much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and contentment as theirs doth?</hi>
                     </p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, what joy and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, what peace and contentment ſoever they have, it is no real joy, no real peace and contentment, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi>
14.13. <hi>Even in laughter the heart is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie;</hi> ſo it is with many of them, even in their revelling and roaring fits, when you would think they had ſung away care, and drunk away ſorrow, there is heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe at their heart, the guilt of ſome ſin as heavie as a Mill-ſtone upon their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; they have many heart-qualmes, though they put never ſo good a face upon the matter, the joy and pleaſure that they have, is but as the joy and pleaſure of a man in a dream, <hi>As when a hungry man dreameth, and behold hee eateth, but hee awaketh and his ſoul is empty; or, as when a thirſty man dreameth, and behold he drinketh, but he awaketh, and behold he is faint, and his ſoul hath appetite,</hi> Iſa. 29.8.
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:170316:169"/>or as the joy and pleaſure of a Mad-man, who hath no rational ground for his joy in any thing, it is but the working of imagination, and will quickly end in real ſorrow, as it is threatned, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.11. <hi>Behold all yee that kindle a fire, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe your ſelves about with ſparks, walk in the light of your fire, and in the ſparks that yee have kindled, this ſhall yee have at mine hand, yee ſhall lye down in ſorrow,</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nothing will ſo furiouſly fly in the face of Conſcience at the laſt, as the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Sin of Self-ſeeking, though men will not ſee the aggravation of it now, they ſhall ſee it then, and yet many have ſome glimpſes of it in this life; and this is the reaſon why they are ſo puzled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their title to heaven and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and why their evidences are ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigious, and ſnarled, becauſe of a ſecret lurking of Selfiſhneſſe as yet not thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denied, and while it is thus, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible there ſhould be any true peace in the ſoul; <hi>What peace</hi> (ſaid <hi>Jehu</hi>) ſo long as the Whoredomes of Jezabel

48.22. falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets may ſpeake peace, and a ſeduced heart, but God will not ſpeake it, whoſe ſole Prerogative it is to ſpeake and give it. The Wiſdome from above is firſt pure, and then peaceable, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17. there muſt be purity before there can bee
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:170316:169"/>peace, the word which is tranſlated pure, ſignifies chaſte, the Wiſdome that is from above is firſt chaſte; now what is Self-denial but the chaſtity of the Soul, in keeping its conjugal love for Jeſus Chriſt? where this is, there is peace, peace is an inſeparable companion of Self-denial; <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whoſe minde is ſtayed on thee,</hi> Iſa. 26.3.

                     </p>
                     <p>Sin is the moſt ſhameful evil, becauſe it is the greateſt debaſing of Excellency, and that for this reaſon, becauſe it brings a man into the moſt ſhameful vaſſallage and ſlavery of any thing in the world. All ſlavery is ſhameful, but this <hi>the most ſhameful,</hi> becauſe hereby the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is moſt abuſed, being uſed to a quite contrary end to that for which it was made. The end of man is to glorifie God, and to injoy him for ever, in theſe two his chief good doth conſiſt; but by ſin neither of theſe are attainable, for as in ſin there is no conformity unto God, ſo there is no communion with him; and therefore a ſinner, as he doth nothing for the glory of God, ſo he doth nothing for his own good, whatſoever he doth while he ſins, it is to his own hurt, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt hurt that a creature is capable of; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the more he ſins, the more he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives himſelf of the chief good; becauſe the more he ſins, the more hee deprives himſelf of God. Now a ſelfiſh man, ſuch an one as cannot deny himſelf, <hi>cannot ceaſe from ſin,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.14. and therefore cannot ceaſe from doing himſelf miſchief, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he works out his damnation, in every
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170316:175"/>thing that he doth, deſtruction and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry are in all his wayes; which ſhews that he is in the moſt wretched and miſerable bondage of any in the world.</p>
                     <p>It is nothing, that what he doth, he doth willingly, for the more willingly any one acts to his own hurt, the more wretched and miſerable he is, as when a man cuts and wounds himſelf, as every ſelfiſh man doth, the woful effects whereof, though for the preſent he doth not feel, if free grace prevent not, he will certainly rue to all eternity.</p>
                     <p>His heart is ſo ſet upon his ſinful wayes, that there is no turning him out of them, neither promiſes on the one hand, nor threatnings on the other, are ſufficient to reclaim him.
<hi>Hee feedeth of aſhes, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived heart hath turned him aſide, that hee cannot deliver his ſoul, nor ſay, Is there not a lye in my right hand?</hi> Iſa. 44.20. Though he be convinced in his conſcience, as many times he is, that the courſe he takes will be his ruine, yet he is ſo miſerably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled by his luſts, that he cannot give over. Though the
<hi>Adulterer</hi> know, that by means of a whoriſh woman, a man is brought to a peece of bread, and that the Adultereſs will hunt for the precious life, that ſhee hath caſt down many wounded, yea that many ſtrong men have been ſlain by her, and that her houſe is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:170316:175"/>death; though he know that the dead bee there, and that her gueſts are in the depths of hell, yet hee will not obey the voyce of his teachers, nor incline his ear to them that inſtruct him, to remove his way far from her, and not to come nigh the door of her houſe, but after her he goes, hee goes the way to her houſe in the twy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, in the evening, in the black and dark night till ſtrangers be filled with his wealth, and his labours be in the houſe of a ſtranger, till a dart ſtrike through his liver, and his fleſh and his body are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed. Though the <hi>Covetous</hi> man knows that when hee dyeth, hee ſhall carry no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing away, and that his glory ſhall not deſcend after him, yet how doth he labour to be rich! riſing up early, and ſitting up late, and eating the bread of ſorrows! though he hear that Covetouſneſs is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and that the love of the world is enmity againſt God, and how
<hi>almoſt an impoſsible</hi> thing it is for a rich man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdome of heaven, though God himſelf ſay it, he will not beleeve it, he is reſolved to have ſomething of the world, though he loſe his ſoul for it, and therefore will fawn and flatter, lye and diſſemble, couzen and cheat, do any thing, ſubmit to any thing, ſo he may but get a penny by it. Who hath wo? who hath ſorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babling? who hath wounds without cauſe?
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170316:176"/>who hath redneſs of the eyes? They that tarry long at the wine (ſaith
<hi>Solomon</hi>) they that go to ſeek mixt wine, and yet <hi>the Drunkard</hi> will not beware, hee looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth it ſelf aright, though at the laſt it biteth like a Serpent, and ſtingeth like an Adder. His eyes behold the ſtrange woman, and his heart utters perverſe things; he is as hee that lyeth down in the midſt of the Sea, or as hee that lyeth upon the top of a Maſt. They have ſtricken mee (ſaith hee) and I was not ſick, they have beaten mee, and I felt it not; when ſhall I awake? I will ſeek it yet again.</p>
                     <p>How miſerable is the condition of theſe men, that are made to ſerve in this manner to their own deſtruction! and yet it is not by any outward force upon them, onely they are drawn away of their own luſt and inticed. Some perceiving they have of their own wretchedneſs, but alas! they cannot help themſelves, they can do nothing in order to their recovery. Though the moſt effectual means be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, they have no heart to make uſe of them, they are fettered with their luſts as with chains, and cannot move one ſtep in the way that leads to life.</p>
                     <p>Here then is the Excellency of Self-denial, that by means thereof, as nothing can conſtrain us to do any thing that is
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170316:176"/>for our hurt, ſo nothing can reſtrain us from doing any thing that is for our good. So long as wee deny our ſelves, neither men nor devils can ſtop us in our way.

This is no motive to ſuch as think it their only liberty to ſin, but to ſuch as prize their ſpiritual and eternal good, being convinced that by the free exerciſing of themſelves unto godlineſs, it is only attainable, it will be a prevailing argument not only to begin, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the ſtricteſt courſe of Self-denial according to the precepts and practice of their Saviour.</p>

Let us therefore conſider our wayes, if they bee not the wayes of the Lord, that wee now walk in, we muſt of neceſſity turn out of them before wee can turn unto the Lord, and this wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do, unleſs wee ſearch and try them; for thoſe that are out of their way, and yet think they are right, will never turn back, but go on further and further, till they quite loſe themſelves. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent then from this Scripture, how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful it is in order to the practice of Self-denial, that wee ſearch and try our wayes; And certainly, if ever wee mean to do any thing to purpoſe herein, wee muſt make a thorough ſearch and ſcrutiny in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:170316:181"/>our hearts and wayes, an exact inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into our principles, our rules, our ends, and aimes in all our undertakings, wee muſt throughly ſift our thoughts affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that wee may ſee what bran of ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lyes at the bottome: For how can a man deny himſelf, that doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand any thing in himſelf that ſhould bee denied? <hi>The firſt ſtep toward a cure, is to finde out the diſeaſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It would bee very advantagious there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that which would much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to our ſucceſs in this work, to have much in our thoughts theſe two things; The poſſibility of being deceived, and the difficulty of the diſcovery: The one would provoke us to jealouſie, the other would quicken us to diligence.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The poſſibility of being deceived. Wee ſhould enter upon the examination of ourſelves with ſuch a ſuppoſition as this, 'There may be much more of Self in mee than I have ever yet taken notice of. It is good to have a holy jealouſie of our ſelves; this would make us very cautelous and wary in the trial of our ſelves; as when a Magiſtrate meets with a ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon, it makes him inquire the more narrowly into him, that ſo hee may diſcover the better what hee is.</p>
                     <p>Object. <hi>But I have been of the opinion a long time that I have denied my ſelf, and have had much peace and comfort in it,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:170316:181"/>why then ſhould I ſuspect my ſelf, and thereby create new troubles in my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. When the ſtrong man keeps the houſe all is in peace, <hi>Luke</hi>
11.21. So long as Self bears rule, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to diſturb him, no wonder that all is quiet.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Some that have thought ſo, have notwithſtanding at the laſt found that they were deceived, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 It is more than probable, that thou art the man, becauſe that thou art un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to come to the trial, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.20, 21.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Unleſs thou haſt very good grounds ſo to think of thy ſelf, it is but a meer fancy and imagination, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.20.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 The comfort that this gives, will quickly vaniſh, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.6. and leave the greater anguiſh and vexation behinde it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.11. But</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Grant it bee true, as thou ſayeſt, yet let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt hee fall, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. A ſelf-doubting Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian will ſtand, when a ſelf confident one will fall.</p>
                     <p>Give mee leave therefore to ſet before you a few inſtances out of the word, the ſerious conſideration whereof may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke you to jealouſie.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 It is poſſible to bee much converſant in the performance of the ſtricteſt duties, and yet to have reſpect to the ſatisfying of ſome baſe ſelf-end in all that is done; as <hi>they,</hi> Iſa. 58. of whom God ſaith, <hi>They ſeek mee daily, and delight to know my wayes, as a Nation that did righteouſneſs, and for ſook not the Ordinance of their God, they ask of mee the Ordinances of Juſtice, they take delight in approaching to God,</hi> verſ. 2. and yet hee tells them, <hi>Behold in the day of your Eaſt yee finde pleaſure, and exact all your labours!

8.19.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 It is poſſible to be a zealous preacher of Chriſt, and yet to preach onely out of envy and ſtrife, and not of good will, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.15, 16.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 It is poſſible to pretend much to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality, and to ſpeak much on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the poor, and yet bee very cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, as <hi>Judas,</hi> Joh. 12.6.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 It is poſſible to bee zealous and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive in reformation, and the execution of juſtice, and yet to do all to ſerve ones own turn, as <hi>Jehu,</hi> 2 King. 10.16.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 It is poſſible to bee zealous in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of others, and yet continue in the ſame or worſe evils at the very ſame time, as the <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> Matth. 7.3, 4, 5. and the <hi>hypocritical Preacher,</hi> Rom. 2.21.22.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 It is poſſible to bee very confident of cleaving unto Chriſt, and yet afterwards to deny him to ſave ones ſelf, as <hi>Peter,</hi> who, when our <hi>Saviour</hi> told the Diſciples that they ſhould all bee offended becauſe of him, preſently returned this anſwer, <hi>Though all men ſhall bee offended becauſe of thee, yet will I never bee offended:</hi> and yet
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:170316:183"/>afterwards hee denied him thrice, and twice with curſing and ſwearing,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 26.70.74.</p>
                     <p>Many more inſtances might bee given, but theſe may ſuffice, to ſhew how eaſily wee may bee miſtaken in our ſelves, and our actions, and therefore how needful it is, to begin and to proceed in this work of ſelf-trial with a godly jealouſie. More may poſſibly bee diſcovered than at firſt wee could have imagined was in us, and yet when wee have done all, much will lye hid. And therefore there is another thing that ſhould alſo bee much in our thoughts, and that is;</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The difficulty of the diſcovery. The heart of man is deceitful above all things, who can know it? <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. Two things there are which render it very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult,
<hi>Self-conceit,</hi> and <hi>Self-love.</hi> Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally wee have a good opinion of our ſelves; though wee bee black, wee think our ſelves comely, and though it bee not ſo, wee would fain have it to bee ſo; and <hi>Quod volumus, facile credimus,</hi> becauſe wee would have it ſo, wee eaſily beleeve it is ſo. Therefore others more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſee more of <hi>Self</hi> in us, than wee do our ſelves, ſpecially if they have an <hi>evil eye</hi> towards us, for enemies, though they bee <hi>bad judges,</hi> yet they are quick diſcerners, becauſe in them that affection is lacking, which in others blinds their eyes,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:170316:183"/>that though they ſee, they cannot diſcern the faults that be in their friends. There is a difficulty alſo in reſpect of the thing it ſelf, which is to be ſought out, eſpecially if the wayes that we walk in be good in themſelves, ſuch as are commanded, ſuch as are commended in the <hi>Word.</hi> There is ſomething of Self will creep into the beſt actions, and there are many ſecret <hi>Fibrae,</hi> many ſmall ſproutings forth of Self, which but to an <hi>Eagle-eyed Chriſtian</hi> are undiſcernable. We muſt not therefore onely look into our own hearts, and into our own wayes, but into the <hi>Looking-glaſs</hi> that God hath provided for this end, namely his word. This is no flattering-glaſs, but a glaſs that will truly repreſent unto us not onely the face and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of our outward actions, but of the inward and ſecret workings of our hearts. And this work of examination muſt bee our daily work: Self-denial is a daily work, and therefore wee muſt try our ſelves daily. If wee are to enterpriſe any thing, it will bee good to examine which way our hearts work before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, that ſo we may not diſpleaſe God, by pleaſing of our ſelves, nor loſe him by ſeeking our ſelves. While wee are in the action, let us carefully take notice of thoſe <hi>ſecret overtures and aſſaies,</hi> that Self will bee ready to make toward ſome ſiniſter end, or other, that ſo when wee come to
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:170316:184"/>the <hi>review;</hi> when the action is ended, wee may bee able to ſay in this particular, namely that which tended much to the glory of God, Self was very backward; in that particular; namely, that which made for my own advantage, honour, or applauſe, Self was very forward; Self would fain have been doing here, but there, it would have done juſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
                     <p>To help you in this Examination, put theſe Queſtions to your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Whether you can reſolve before hand againſt ſatisfying your luſts (either by doing any thing that is forbidden, or omitting any thing that is injoyned) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though for the preſent you have no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for it or temptation to it. It may bee ſometimes ſuch a particular ſin comes into your thoughts, which but at ſuch a time and place, &amp;c. cannot bee committed, both which for the preſent are wanting, and you are much preſſed in your ſpirit to reſolve againſt it; Now if you bee loath to reſolve againſt it, if you would
<hi>ſtill</hi> be at an indifferency, if you be unwilling to come under an engagement, it is an ill ſign.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Whether you do effectually ſtrive againſt every known ſin, diligently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king uſe of all the means you know to be appointed by God for the ſubduing of it,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:170316:184"/>and carefully avoiding all the occaſions that may poſſibly lead you to it; if not, what may bee the reaſon? It may bee you are tempted to uncleanneſs, you will pray againſt it, but you will not faſt and pray, you will not keep under your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and bring them into ſubjection by temperance and hard labour, &amp;c. It may bee you will deny to commit the act of Adultery, but not to look upon a Maiden.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Whether you can deny your ſelves when you have an opportunity for the ſatisfying of your luſts, when you have a fit ſeaſon for ſelf-ſeeking, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing your own ends? Whether or no you can deny your ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 In time of power and authority. <hi>Magiſtratus judicat virum,</hi> there is a great deal of difference in ſome men from what they were before, when once they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced into places of Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, becauſe that is a fit ſeaſon for a ſelfiſh man to ſerve himſelf in; but a ſelf-denying man is the ſame afterwards, that hee was before. See 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> 6.14. <hi>Neh.</hi> 5. throughout.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 In time of advantage gotten over enemies. See 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.4, 5.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 In time of great danger, when either ſin or ſuffering muſt bee choſen. See
<hi>Dan.</hi> 3.17, 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 In time of being in favour with
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:170316:185"/>great ones. God had brought <hi>Daniel</hi> into favour and tender love with the Prince of the Eunuchs, yet hee would not defile himſelf with the Kings meat, at his requeſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.8, 9, 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 In time of great applauſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. See <hi>Act.</hi> 14.14, 15.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 In time of ſecrecie. See <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.11.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 When your affections are eagerly ſet upon a thing. See 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.16, 17.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 When affronted and wronged and the paſſion is up, and you are bent upon revenge. See
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.32.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Whether you can bee contented to bee denied by others.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It may bee in words you will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value your ſelves, but you cannot indure that others ſhould undervalue you.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 It may bee you will refuſe places of honour, but not indure that others ſhould take the refuſal.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Whether you can indure to hear others commended, and to ſee them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced without repining, not thinking it any reflection upon your ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Whether you can willingly and cheerfully bee inſtrumental in honouring of others, that ſeem to ſleight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne you.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 When perſons count you no thanks, but render evil for good, whether then you can rejoyce in the good that you have done for them, and cheerfully go
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:170316:185"/>on to do them good, as before.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Whether you can bee content to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny your ſelves when none can take notice of it, as</p>
                     <p n="1">1 When you bee alone, or in a ſtrange place.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 When few do the ſame that you do, it being a duty not in faſhion, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Whether you can deny your ſelves when it comes to bee your owncaſe. See 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> 12.5.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 Whether you can deny your ſelves in little things, as meat, and drink, and apparrel, giving place to others, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 Whether you can deny your very Self-denial. See <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. and 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4.</p>
                     <p>By queſtioning with your ſelves in this manner you may come to know what of Self there is in you, which is the firſt thing that is to bee done in order to the practice of Self-denial.</p>

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:170316:186"/>unto Gods teſtimonies, yet it is implied that he denied himſelf, this being a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary antecedent to it; but how came it to paſs that hee did ſo? why hee tells us in the former words; <hi>I thought upon my wayes,</hi> I conſidered the evill of them, and then turned out of them. Hee went on very confidently and contentedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but it was becauſe hee did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whither hee was going, hee did not ponder his paths; but as ſoon as he began to reflect upon himſelf, and to conſider where hee was, and whither hee was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how hee diſhonoured God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed his own ſoul in thoſe wayes, hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently makes a ſtop, and turns about unto Gods teſtimonies. This is the reaſon why men go on ſo long time together in a ſinful courſe, why they walk in the way of their heart, and the ſight of their eyes, without any regret of conſcience: It is becauſe they do not conſider what they are doing, nor whither they are going, like the young man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.22.23. that being inticed by the lewd woman, hee goeth after her ſtreightway, as an Oxe goeth to the ſlaughter, as a Bird haſteth to the ſnare, and knoweth not, <hi>i. e.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth not that it is for his life.

                        <pb n="321" facs="tcp:170316:186"/>Oh! if ever wee mean in good earneſt to deny our ſelves, and to follow the Lord fully in the paths of righteouſneſs and holineſs, let us every day ſteep our thoughts in a ſerious meditation of the exceeding ſinfulneſs of ſelf-pleaſing, and ſelf-ſeeking, of making proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the luſts thereof. As a man will not come after Chriſt in obedience to his call in the Goſpel, till hee appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it to be good, yea abſolutely beſt for him ſo to do; ſo hee will not give a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory denial to the requeſts and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of <hi>Self,</hi> till hee apprehend it to bee evill, yea the greateſt evill in the world to yeeld unto them.

                     <p n="1">1 The Evil of <hi>Injuſtice. Juſtitia eſt ſuum cuique dare,</hi> Juſtice conſiſts in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to every one his due, according to our <hi>Saviours rule,</hi> Matth.
22.21. <hi>Render unto Caſar the things that are Caeſars, and to God the things that are Gods,</hi> and that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.7. Render <hi>unto all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, cuſtome to whom cuſtome, fear to whom fear, honour to whom honour.</hi> Now Self keeps back both from God and man that which is their due. 1 From God. Our ſoules are his, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.4. our bodies his, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. but Self keeps back both from him, it imployes all the powers and faculties of both as inſtruments of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs unto ſin. 2 From men.
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:170316:187"/>Self is the cauſe of all that unjuſt deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that defrauding and going beyond one another; of all that extortion and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion that is in the world. Self will not ſuffer the proud man to give honour to whom honour is due, nor the covetous man to give tribute to whom tribute is due; nor the envious man to give love to whom love is due; nor the mercileſs man, mercy to whom mercy is due.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The Evil of Idolatry. A Selfiſh man is the <hi>man of ſin,</hi> that exalts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above all that is called God; he makes himſelf his god, hee falls down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips himſelf, making himſelf his ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end in every thing hee doth, and walking by his own rule, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Evil of Unthankfulneſs. If hee hath any thing more than others, hee boaſts as if hee had not received it, if hee hath any thing leſs, hee murmures as if hee had not his due.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The Evil of Unbeleef. Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever will ſave his life ſhall loſo it, and whoſoever will loſe his life for my ſake, ſhall finde it,</hi> Matth. 16.25. And that <hi>it is better (for him) to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands, or two feet, to bee caſt into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire,</hi> Matth. 18.8. but hee will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it, and ſo makes Chriſt a lyar.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 The Evil of Unmercifulneſs. By ſeeking himſelf hee loſeth himſelf, by
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:170316:188"/>endeavouring to ſave himſelf, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes himſelf. This is the greateſt cruelty in the World. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.17.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 There is much of the Devil in it: When <hi>Peter</hi> tempted our Saviour to ſave himſelf from the ſhameful death of the Croſs, hee ſaid, <hi>Get thee behinde mee Satan.</hi> Hee calls him Satan, not only becauſe hee tempted him, but becauſe of the ſin to which hee tempted him. All ſin is the Devils, <hi>Vel per modum imaginis, vel per modum ſervitutis,</hi> either by way of like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſervice to him, ſelfiſhneſs is ſo in both reſpects.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 It is the great Make-bate in the world, the great divider, it divides men from God, and men one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 It is the onely hindrance of mens cloſing with Chriſt. The young man could not cloſe with Chriſt, becauſe hee could not deny himſelf.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 This cauſeth God to reject all our ſervices, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.5.</p>
                     <p n="10">10 It is a contradiction to our prayers. <hi>Latimer</hi> ſaid of <hi>Peter,</hi> that when hee tempted Chriſt, hee forgot his <hi>Pater noſter,</hi> for that was, <hi>Thy Kingdome come, Thy will bee done.</hi>

The branch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bring forth fruit of it ſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.4. As the branch hath its being from the root, ſo likewiſe its fruit, therefore when once cut off from the root, it withers; But though the branches wither, the root withers not, but brings forth new branches, and new fruit in them. There is hope of a tree if it bee cut down (ſaith
<hi>Job</hi>) that it will ſprout again, <hi>Job</hi> 14.8. There is fear that this will ſprout again. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaw in a Viſion, a goodly Tree, concerning which one cryed,

                     <p n="1">1 Not to the commiſſion of any known ſin; I ſay any known ſin, which you know is either expreſly, or by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence forbidden in the word. For if you bee moved to the doing of any thing, which (for ought you can underſtand from the word) is neither expreſly, nor by conſequence forbidden, and this thought preſently ariſe in your hearts that it is unlawful, and therefore may not bee done. Here a parley is not onely lawful, but a duty; that is, before you lay a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint upon your ſelves (ſo as not to do it) out of a reſpect of unlawfulneſs, you are to conſider it, whether there bee any ſuch reſpect of unlawfulneſs put upon it by any negative command of God; for neither we, nor any other creatures either in heaven or earth, can make more ſins than God hath made, nor may wee out of conſcience lay a reſtraint upon our ſelves, where God hath laid none.</p>
                     <p>Many perſons have much wronged themſelves in this particular, by laying a conſcientious reſtraint upon themſelves from the doing of ſome actions, and the injoying of ſome things, which in their own nature are indifferent, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance whereof is not abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, nor (it may bee) in reſpect of their particular caſe, alwayes expedient;
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:170316:191"/>and hence they have yeelded to the doing of ſuch actions, and the enjoying of ſuch things oftentimes with wavering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, even before they have been fully convinced of the lawfulneſs of them, ſo as to have done what they did out of faith.</p>
                     <p>Some (as it is ordinary amongſt the Papiſts) think they may not lawfully eat fleſh, nor drink wine, though the neceſſity of their bodies bee ſuch, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live without it, or that they may not lawfully eat above one meal a day, and that a very ſpare one too, whereas their ſtomach calls for more. Now while this opinion and conceit laſts, they dare not think it may bee done, and yet the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and neceſſity of nature is ſuch, that it often puts them upon the uſe of theſe things notwithſtanding, and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conſcience flyes in their face for ſelf-pleaſing, and hypocriſie, and they have gone up and down diſquieted and perplexed all their dayes. And there is this ſnare in it likewiſe; It often puts men upon the commiſſion of ſome things that are expreſly forbidden, and the uſe of ſome things abſolutely unlawful. As amongſt the Papiſts, many that are in <hi>Orders</hi> (as they expreſs it) think it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to marry; yet theſe, having not the gift of continency, fall often into the ſin of Fornication and Adultery; and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:170316:191"/>hence again conſcience is diſquieted.</p>
                     <p>The caſe of ſuch perſons muſt needs bee very wretched and miſerable, which is plainly implied by the Apoſtle in thoſe words, <hi>Happy is the man that condemneth not himſelf in any thing which hee alloweth,</hi> Rom. 14.22. Hee cannot be happy, whoſe conſcience doth accuſe him for the doing of that, which hee eſteems as lawful to be done; for this man is as it were rackt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two opinions, of the lawfulneſs and unlawfulneſs of what hee doth; he thinks hee may not do it, yet, that it is not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in it ſelf, and others do it, therefore he doth it; and while hee is doing it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his opinion of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it in the general, yet hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns himſelf, his doing it in particular, and makes himſelf worthy of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too, in doing it before hee bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded out of the word of God, that hee approveth of it, though indeed hee do, and therefore it follows, verſ. 23. <hi>And hee that doubteth, is damned if he eat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee eateth not of faith, and what ſoever is not of faith, is ſin;</hi> that is, whatſoever is done by any one out of a wavering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, not fully aſſured that the work hee doth is pleaſing to God, as having warrant from his word, to him it is ſin.</p>
                     <p>Now as wee are not to do any thing which wee think is unlawful, while wee
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:170316:192"/>think it is unlawful; ſo wee are not to forbear out of conſcience of avoyding ſin, meerly by the not doing of it, untill wee bee aſſured that it is a ſin to do it, but ſearch the minde of God in the Scripture concerning it, whether it bee a ſin or not, and if not, wee are not to forbear it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that notion; nay though wee ſhould bee enjoyned by men to forbear ſuch things as are lawful in themſelves, under this notion of unlawfulneſs, wee are not to yeeld unto them. <hi>Let no man judge you</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>in meats and drinks, or in reſpect of an holy-day,</hi> Col. 2.16. and <hi>let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility,</hi> verſ. 18. as if hee had ſaid, Permit no man to uſurp a power of domineering over your conſiences, and of judging them guilty in theſe things, which now are not forbidden; and let no man take the prize which is held forth unto you, by drawing you aſide, under pretence of voluntary humility, to thoſe opinions and obſervances. The reaſon hee ſubjoyns, verſ. 20. <hi>For you are dead with Chriſt from the rudiments of the world,</hi> therefore you ought not be ſubject to them. What rudiments and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances theſe were, hee ſhews in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words.
<q>
                           <hi>Touch not, Taſte not, Handle not.</hi>
                        </q> Theſe were the doctrines and commands of ſuperſtitious men, and (you ſee) they were of forbearance of
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:170316:192"/>thoſe things which God had not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and therefore hee calls them,
<hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances after the commandements and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of men,</hi> verſ. 22. and in the next verſe, <hi>will-worſhip,</hi> which (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>ſhew of wiſdome and humility</hi> that is in it, <hi>in neglecting the body,</hi> yet) hath nothing of either of them in truth and reality, and therefore not to bee yeelded to upon any command of any man whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>This then (you ſee) is clear, that wee are not to forbear in things lawfull (if wee have occaſion to uſe them) under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of avoyding ſin, if God hath not forbidden the uſe of them; yet here this rule takes place, <hi>Till you know it not to bee a ſin, do it not.</hi> For when any thing is queſtionable, it is good to take the ſafeſt courſe, namely to forbear, it may be there is ſin in doing it, but I am ſure there is none in forbearing, I will not run upon a hazzard while all is well.</p>
                     <p>But now to come to that which is mainly intended, If it bee a known ſin to which you are moved, then do not<note n="k" place="margin">Ea delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa omnino non ſunt in quibus eſt turpis ipſa de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberatio.

A remarkable inſtance for this wee have in the ſtory of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 39.7, 8.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:170316:193"/>
                        <hi>And it came to paſs after theſe things, that his Maſters wife cast her eyes upon Joſeph, and ſhee ſaid, Lye with mee, but hee refuſed, and ſaid, How can I do this great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> Well, ſee how ſhee follows him after this, and how hee perſiſts in denying her, verſ. 10. <hi>And it came to paſs as ſhee spake unto Joſeph day by day, that hee hearkned not unto her, to lye by her, or to bee with her,</hi> yet ſhee gives not over, for verſ. 11. <hi>when Joſeph went into the houſe to do his buſineſs, and there were none of the men of the houſe there within, ſhee caught him by his garment, ſaying, Lye with mee;</hi> but hee left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out; hee ſtayes not to parley with her, not ſo much as to reaſon with her againſt her lewd motion, becauſe the temptation came to ſuch an height, it was more ſafe to flye from it than to fight with it, and by this means hee preſerved his chaſtity. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is better in this caſe than a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory denial. When <hi>Abiſhai</hi> would have perſwaded <hi>David</hi> to have ſlain <hi>Shimei,</hi> he gave him a peremptory denial, ſaying, <hi>What have I to do with you, yee Sons of Zerviah?</hi> So our <hi>Saviour,</hi> when <hi>Peter</hi> tempted him to ſave himſelf, hee gave him a peremptory denial, <hi>Get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde mee Sathan.</hi> There is but little hope of denying our ſelves when once wee ſo far yeeld, as to conſult and parley in time
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:170316:193"/>of temptation. In any temptation, if Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than can but obtain thus much, hee hath gotten half the victory. It is a ſign a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged enemy will not long hold out, when once hee yeelds to a Treaty. Wee ſee this in <hi>Eve,</hi> the firſt that ever was tempted, and the firſt that ever was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by temptation; Sathan ſaid unto her, <hi>Yea, hath God ſaid, yee ſhall not eat of every tree of the Garden?</hi> If this was the beginning of his ſpeech, it was very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, but ſome think the words do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe a precedent parley, wherein hee made his entrance into the matter in a more rhetorical manner. Shee ſhould have done as the deaf Adder that ſtops his ear, and will not hearken to the voyce of the Charmer, charm hee never ſo wiſely, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.4, 5. but ſhee had a mind to hear what Sathan could ſay, and ſo ere ſhee was aware, was perſwaded by him to taſte the forbidden fruit. Thus <hi>Balaam</hi> after hee had conſulted with the temptation, yeelds to curſe the people of God, <hi>Numb.</hi>
22.22. hee had a great minde to the reward that was promiſed, and therefore conſulted how far hee might yeeld. It is dangerous entertaining thoughts how far wee may yeeld, where wee ſhould not yeeld at all. While wee think to yeeld but a little, wee yeeld alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                     <p>If you would therefore deny your

Take this courſe then, when you are tempted to any thing that is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, chide away the temptation with an angry denial, ſay, Get thee hence Sathan. It is true Chriſt ſuffered himſelf to bee tempted again and again, three times following, before hee put the Tempter to flight; but this is not imitable by us, hee had ſtrength enough whereby to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the temptation when hee would, yet you ſee in the third temptation (for our imitation) he ſaid,
<hi>Get thee hence Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than.</hi> If you give not a peremptory de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial at the firſt, you give the Devil ſome hopes of prevailing, and you will never bee rid of a temptation till you have done it. As for example, A beggar comes to your door, and is importunate for ſomething, you tell him you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him, the times are hard with you, you cannot ſerve every one that comes, with much more to this purpoſe; but all this will not make him bee gone, till you ſay peremptorily, let him ſtay never ſo long, you will give him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:170316:194"/>and then hee goes his way. Why thus you muſt do with Sathan, which if you do, within a while hee will leave you. <hi>Reſiſt the Devil</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle)
<hi>and hee will flye from you,</hi> Jam 4.7. The <hi>French</hi> have a Proverb, <hi>When the Spaniard comes to parley of peace, then double bolt the door;</hi> ſo when Sathan comes to treat of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, bar up the doors, give him no audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

<hi>Where there is no Law</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>there is no tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> ſo where there is no Law, there is no obedience. Whatſoever therefore wee do as matter of obedience unto God, muſt have a command from God, elſe it is will-worſhip, and that is abominable. <hi>Cultus non inſtitutus non eſt acceptus, In vain do they worſhip mee</hi> (ſaith our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>) <hi>teaching for doctrine the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men,</hi> Matth.

4.9, 10. that is (as ſome) in point of worſhip, that worſhip which they thought was moſt ſuitable to their own politick ends, that worſhip they ſet up, but by this they provoked the Lord. It is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough if it be no where expreſly forbidden, if it bee not commanded, we are not to do it. Though our ends and aimes be never ſo good, wee may not do evil that the greateſt good may come thereof. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when wee are moved to do any thing under the notion of a duty, and we are not fully perſwaded out of the word that it is a duty, wee not onely may, but ought to deliberate till wee can certainly inform ourſelves. And yet, while wee beleeve it to bee a duty, and cannot by any means bee convinced to the contrary, though in reallity it bee not ſo, yet wee muſt do it, becauſe an erring conſcience bindes; for till wee bee fully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that wee may and ought to omit it, wee cannot omit in faith, and if not in faith, wee ſhould condemn our ſelves to omit it. But now on the contrary, If it bee a duty, and wee know it to bee a duty, if now wee have a temptation to neglect it, wee may not parley with this temptation, but forthwith ſet upon the performance of it. <hi>When thou ſaideſt, ſeeke yee my face, my heart ſaid unto thee, Thy face Lord will I ſeeke,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi>

This is that which God expects whenſoever he commands us any thing, that wee ſhould obey without diſputing, without reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without anſwering again. It is the Devils policy to gain time, to prevail with us to put off duties, for then hee knows it is more than probable that wee will omit them. Some are alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, but ſeldome or never performing, <hi>ſemper victuri,</hi> alwayes beginning to live, but never live in good earneſt.

This is the middle here meant when wee are neither in the defect, nor in the exceſs in the uſe of our lawful liberty.

He that would not fall into the River, muſt not go too near the brink. Hee that will go as far as hee may go, is in danger to go further than hee ſhould go. If wee go one mile in the way of lawful, take heed wee go not two in the way of non-expedient.
<hi>All things are lawful for mee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>but all things are not expedient,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.23. There are many things indifferent, and we may lawſully uſe them, but we may ſin in uſing them, if wee obſerve not the rule of expediency. This is the rule to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the uſe of things lawful in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <hi>How much is expedient?</hi> ſo far wee may go in the uſe of them, but no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is not enough that the things bee lawful in themſelves, but are they expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient? are they neceſſary? Here many perſons foulely erre, that care for no more but to know that ſuch things bee
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:170316:196"/>lawful they will have them, they will make uſe of them, though in the uſe of them they bee ſcandalous. They think becauſe there is no hurt in them, they may take liberty to ſatisfie their luſſs in them. There is much danger in this, and the rather, becauſe of the pretence of liberty. It was the complaint of old, <hi>Licitis perimus omnes,</hi> many ſin exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and go to hell for ſinning in the uſe of things lawful and indifferent. Though the things bee lawful in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet when men ſhall let out their hearts inordinately upon them, and ſpend ſo much time in giving themſelves pleaſure and contentment in them, that they indiſpoſe themſelves for the ſervice of God, they ſin exceedingly in the uſe of them. That which is ſaid of the <hi>Law,</hi> may bee ſaid of ſports and pleaſures, and other things that are indifferent. <hi>The Law is good if a man uſe it lawfully,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.8. So theſe are good if wee uſe them law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.

This then ſhews how neceſſary this Direction is in order to Self-denial.

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:170316:197"/>our ſelves in the uſe of thoſe things that are lawful, if wee do not, the fleſh, that is, <hi>Self,</hi> will take an occaſion thereby to carry us on to thoſe things that are abſolutely unlawful. A man that is peremptorily bent to go to the uttermoſt bound, would go further if hee could, and oft-times by Gods permiſſion hee doth, and then hee is in thraldome; for the end of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is the beginning of our bondage.

                     <p>Two ſorts there bee that are under the power of things indifferent.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Such as think they may not be without them, but are bound in conſcience al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies to make uſe of them, ſuppoſing that
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:170316:197"/>otherwiſe they ſhould not ſtand faſt in their Chriſtian liberty, and therefore will make uſe of them at all times, and in all places, and companies, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the conſciences of their weak bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who are thereby offended.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Such as think they cannot bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, but muſt needs have them, or elſe they can take no comfort or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in their lives. There is a great deal of difference betwixt theſe two, the former ſort think they may not, and ſo put a pretence of duty upon the uſe of them, theſe think they cannot, and ſo make it a matter of neceſſity. It is a flattering kinde of tyranny that under pretence of neceſſity ſeizeth on ſuch men. It is true wee are made under the power of ſome things, <hi>Lege naturae,</hi> by the Law of nature, but there are other things that wee are under, <hi>Lege peccati &amp; mortis,</hi> onely by the Law of ſin and death. To eat, and drink, and cloath our ſelves, and now and then to recreate our ſelves, &amp;c. Theſe are things the Law of nature bindes us to, but that wee muſt have meat and drink of ſuch ſeveral ſorts, and cloathing of ſuch faſhions, or elſe wee cannot enjoy our ſelves, this is not from the Law of nature, but ſin; It is onely from our own luſts that wee are under the power of theſe things. And while wee cannot deny our ſelves in theſe
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:170316:198"/>trifles, how do wee think wee ſhall ever bee able to deny our ſelves in things of greater concernment? Self-denial muſt bee univerſal, which cannot bee, ſo long as wee are under the power of any thing indifferent. Wee may uſe them, but firſt wee muſt endeavour to bring them under our power. Wee are never fit to uſe any thing that wee are ſlaves to. Wee ſay of fire, That it is a good ſervant, but a bad Maſter; ſo wee may truly ſay of theſe things, they are good while they bee our ſervants, but bad when they become our Maſters. This was one of the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.7.
<hi>That ſervants did ride upon horſes, and Princes walke as ſervants upon the earth.</hi> To ſee beggarly rudiments, beggarly elements of meats and drinks, &amp;c. (as the Apoſtle calls them) be-jading Princely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouls, this is not onely vanity, but vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit to behold. Theſe things were made to bee our ſervants, and wee to bee the ſervants of God onely; but man having revolted from his Creator, is become a ſubject, nay a ſlave to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. It was the curſe upon <hi>Canaan,</hi> Gen. 9.25. <hi>A ſervant of ſervants ſhall hee bee,</hi> and this curſe they lye under that are ſervants to the creatures. This is the vileſt ſervitude that is, a man may bee in other ſervice, and yet Chriſts free-man, but ſo hee cannot bee in this; <hi>No man can
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:170316:198"/>ſerve two Maſters,</hi> as Chriſt himſelf hath told us,

The Moon is the emblem of all things here below, and wee ſhould labour to bee above them, above them in our love and deſire, our delight, and our converſation; this is to overcome the world, yea to reign over it. Let us labour to bee at an indifferency for the having, or wanting of theſe things which periſh with the uſing. <hi>I have learned in all eſtates to bee content</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>I know how to bee abaſed, and how to abound, how to bee full, and to bee hungry, both to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and to ſuffer need.</hi> Till wee learn this, wee ſhall never bee able to deny our ſelves.</p>

                     <p>This was <hi>Pauls</hi> practice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. <hi>So fight I, not as one that beateth the ayre,</hi> but I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection. Herein conſiſts a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal part of Self-denial. <hi>The Grace</hi> of the Goſpel teacheth us to <hi>deny all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and to live ſoberly,</hi> Tit. 2.11. that is, to moderate our appetite after meats and drinks. The body muſt have its due, ſo much as will make it ſerviceable to the
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:170316:199"/>ſoul, but not too much, for then it will not bee in ſubjection to the ſoul, but u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp an uncontroulable power over it. There is a mutual ſympathy betwixt the ſoul and the body, and the ſoul too often ſympathizeth with the body, and follows the temper of it, eſpecially when it is pampered, when it is ſtuffed with thoſe things that provoke and ſtir up luſt. A man that is cholerick is diſpoſed to paſſion, another that is ſanguine to wantonneſs, another that is melancholick to diſcontent, &amp;c. Every man if he know himſelf will finde, that in reſpect of the temper and conſtitution of his body, hee is more or leſs inclined to ſome peculiar kinde of ſin, or other. Now in this caſe the way to deny ones ſelf, is not onely to work by ſpiritual arguments upon the minde, but to endeavour to alter the temper of the body, by with-holding as much as may bee whatſoever may feed that humour that is predominant in it to the prejudice of the minde. Here then that advice of the Apoſtle is good, <hi>Not to make proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the luſts thereof,</hi> Rom. 13. ult. The body is the ſouls inſtrument, if it have according to its luſts, it will bee altogether unſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and then though the ſoul have never ſo much skill, it will accompliſh nothing worthy of Self. If the organ bee out of tune, the Muſitian can make no melody.
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:170316:199"/>There is a proportionable allowance of meats and exerciſe for the body, which (if it have) render it more able to attend the ſoul, and ſerve it in its nobleſt opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but when this proportion is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, it hath the quite contrary effect. Beware therefore of too much indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to the fleſh, you will never bee able to deny the luſts of the minde, while you cannot deny the luſts of the fleſh, and its juſt with God that our ſouls ſhould be in ſubjection to our bodies, when wee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour not to keep our bodies in ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to our ſouls.</p>

                     <p>By all theſe inſtances it is more than evident, that while men continue igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their own nothingneſs, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that, do think of themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove what is meet, they will never deny themſelves, they will never acknowledge God the Creator as their laſt end, and ſo take him for their chief good, nor God the Mediator as the onely means to the enjoyment of it.

When wee have done all; though wee could do as much as all the Angels in heaven, yet in the concluſion wee muſt ſay, Wee are unprofitable ſervants, and wee muſt cry Grace, Grace, unto the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation wee are made partakers of.</p>
                     <p>Theſe four things put together, ſhew abundantly what ſilly ſorry things wee are, and the ſerious conſideration of any one of them would bee enough, much more of all together, to bring down thoſe high and towring imaginations that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt themſelves againſt God and Jeſus Chriſt, and make you vile and baſe in your own eyes.</p>
                     <p>This would teach you theſe three things; three ſpecial points of Self-denial.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Not to depend upon your ſelves, not to lean to your own wiſdome, not to
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:170316:203"/>follow the imaginations and counſel of your own hearts. When a man ſhall think with himſelf in this manner,
<q>I am nothing, and I can do nothing;</q> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do any thing of my ſelf, not any thing that is good, not any good thing well, either for body or ſoul, the reſult muſt needs bee this,
<q>Why ſhould I then go out in my own ſtrength?</q> Why ſhould I bee ſelf-confident in any thing that I am about to do, as if I could compaſs it by my own ſtrength, or my own policy? There is abundance of Self in this. When men are called forth to act in any private duty or publick ſervice, how apt are they to go out in their own ſtrength, and to act in confidence of their own parts and abilities; As <hi>Peter,</hi> hee would confeſs Chriſt, and ſtick cloſe to him, come what would of it, whoſoever ſhould forſake him, hee would not flinch. Now to help againſt ſuch thoughts as theſe, what better than to act in the ſight and ſenſe of our own nothingneſs? When wee come to preach, or pray, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, or adminiſter juſtice, or buy or ſell, &amp;c. to think thus, Lord of my ſelf I can do nothing, but mine eyes are wholly upon thee.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Not to aſcribe unto your ſelves, this would inable you to ſay, <hi>Non nobis Domine,</hi> Not unto us, Not unto us, O Lord, but to thy Name bee the praiſe
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:170316:203"/>and glory. There is abundance of Self in this, in arrogating and aſcribing all, or part to our ſelves, as if in ſome things we might thank our ſelves, and were not beholding either to God or Chriſt. Wee are very prone if wee have any thing, or if wee have done any thing that is praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, to take the glory of it to our ſelves.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 If wee have any thing that hath an excellency in it, wee are apt to boaſt, as if wee had not received it; which fault the Apoſtle took notice of, and ſharply reprehended amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.7. If wee have a fairer face, a more comely body, a more elegant ſpeech, &amp;c. If wee have a quicker appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, a more acute judgement, a more faithful memory, &amp;c. we are apt to think, if not to boaſt, as if wee had it from our ſelves, and were not beholding for it to another. Now what an excellent means for the curing of this pride and vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory is the conſideration of our own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs! that what wee are, wee are by the grace of God; as the Apoſtle,
<q>
                           <hi>By the grace of God I am that I am;</hi>
                        </q> It is free Grace hath made a difference, where there was none by nature. The neglect of this makes us rob God of abundance of glory.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 If wee have done any thing that hath an excellency in it, wee are too
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:170316:204"/>much taken with it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Wee ſpend time in reflecting upon it in our own thoughts, in admiring our ſelves for it, thinking how bravely wee came off, and how every one admires us, how every one praiſeth us, &amp;c. and ſcarce lift up one thought to God to bleſs him. Thus <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> reflected upon his building of <hi>Babylon; Is not this,</hi> ſaith hee, <hi>great Babylon that I have built?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 Wee would fain have others take notice of it, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> after his ſickneſs would ſhew his Treaſures. <hi>Jehu</hi> would have his zeal obſerved, the Phariſees muſt needs blow the Trumpet. Wee have a kinde of longing that others ſhould take notice of that which wee our ſelves do. If we know any thing, it doth us no good, unleſs ſome take notice that wee are ſo knowing. There is an itching deſire in us to have every thing wee do, made publick. Hence are thoſe frequent ſtories of our ſelves, what wee did, and what wee ſaid.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 If others do commend us, wee are tickled with delight in the hearing ſuch diſcourſes, this is the reaſon of the old Proverb, <hi>Obſequium amices, &amp;c.</hi> flattery begets friends.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Wee are ready to enter into the liſts of contention whenſoever any doth but queſtion our worth in any particular, or deny it. Oh what chafing and fuming is
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:170316:204"/>there, what arrogating expreſſions, what diſdainful language, what odious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons and reflections!</p>
                     <p>Now all this would bee helped, could wee walk in the ſight and ſenſe of our own nothingneſs, then wee ſhould bee as <hi>Peter,</hi> when hee had reſtored the lame man,
<hi>Act.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Not to ſeek our ſelves. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Philippians</hi> that all men ſeek their own things, and not the things of Chriſt, that is, all natural men. Naturally there is ſuch a diſpoſition in us, that wee would ingroſs all to our ſelves, wee would have all the praiſe, all the honour, all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and advantage to our ſelves, and wee cannot indure that any one ſhould bee above us, or before us, that any ones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ſhould prevail beſides our own. And what is the reaſon, but that wee have not learnt the leſſon of our own nothingneſs? Were wee once nothing in our own eyes, wee ſhould bee content to bee nothing in the eyes of others: Could wee deſpiſe our ſelves, wee ſhould bee content that others ſhould deſpiſe us. Were wee but once ſenſible of our own unworthineſs, wee ſhould not take it ill that others have ſo much, and wee ſo little, in all eſtates wee ſhould bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
                     <p>See then how uſeful this Direction is in order to the practice of Self-denial;
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:170316:205"/>many a one that is convinced of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and hath begun the practice of it, is ready to ſay,
<q>I am fully perſwaded that it is my duty to deny my ſelf, and I have made ſome trial of it, but yet I finde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world more croſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to fleſh and blood; I finde I cannot do it.</q> Oh! how hard is it to be contented to do good, and not to be ſeen in it! I am neglected and ſleighted, and I cannot bear it; men do not give mee that honour and reſpect that is due, and I cannot bee without it. Oh! for any direction, any help to make this duty eaſie and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to mee! Why, this is the Direction that I have now given you, this hath been a tryed
<hi>Receipt,</hi> and never failed of a cure. When once you are throughly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of your own nothingneſs, it will bee eaſie to deny your ſelves in all theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars. If a great man come to you, one whom you highly eſteem and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, you can hardly deny him, but if another come that is of no worth, whom you do not value, you can deny him with eaſe, and make nothing of it; ſo it is here, when once you come to ſee your own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs, &amp;c. And till it bee thus, it will bee very irkſome and tedious, very hard and difficult, if not impoſſible to deny your ſelves in any thing. You will have ſuch reaſonings as theſe,
<q>What ſuch an one as I? Shall I bear it, to bee thus
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:170316:205"/>croſſed? thus affronted? thus abuſed? Is it fit that I ſhould bee thus dealt with?</q> but on the contrary, when you are nothing in your own eyes, you will ſay as
<hi>Mephi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſheth</hi> in the like caſe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.28, 30. That which will break a proud mans heart, will not breake an humble mans ſleep.</p>

May the wiſdome of the world bee judge in this caſe, it will bee cenſured as the groſſeſt act of folly that ever any man in the world could bee guilty of; for <hi>Quis niſi mentis inops,</hi> who but one beſides himſelf, who but a mad man, that hath not the uſe of his reaſon, and knows not what hee doth, would refuſe ſuch an honour? Thus if <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould bee arraigned at the tribunal of Carnal reaſon, hee would bee found guilty, and bee condemned for the verieſt fool in the world. I, but to bee ſure <hi>Moſes</hi> was no fool, hee knew what hee did well enough, hee had ſomething elſe in his eye, which hee knew would abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly recompence the loſs of all that honour and pleaſure which hee might have had, had hee continued the Son of

<pb n="365" facs="tcp:170316:208"/>wonder at it, yet at laſt wee conclude, that hee would not have done it for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that there was ſomething in the matter that every one knows not of; that hee had ſomething in his eye which hee preferred before it; and ſo wee may ſay of <hi>Moſes</hi> here, hee would not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed all this honour out of an humour, <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſomewhat elſe in his eye; and what was that?

The Object affects not, but as it is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, it will have no influence upon our wills and affections to prevail to Self-denial, unleſs wee have it in our eye, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs wee behold it. Two things then are herer equired.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 To think upon it. To eye a thing is to have it in our thoughts. The expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is figurative, and this is one thing meant by it, that wee have it much in our thoughts. I ſhall branch out this head into two particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Think upon it ſolemnly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly. It is not a tranſient thought or two, now and then occaſionally that will do the deed, it muſt bee a ſerious thinking; wee muſt think on it over and over, again and again; wee muſt have it continually running in our mindes.
<hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally brethren</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, whatſoever things are juſt, &amp;c. If there bee any vertue, any praiſe, thinke on theſe things,</hi> Phil. 4.8. As wee are to think on our duty, ſo on our reward alſo. <hi>If there bee any vertue, any praiſe.</hi> Wee
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:170316:211"/>yeeld unto Self oftimes out of forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not onely out of forgetfulneſs of the Precept, which tells us what wee ſhould do by way of obedience, but alſo out of forgetfulneſs of the promiſe, which tells us what wee ſhould expect, by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence and reward. Not thinking of the end, makes us go out of the way. The reaſon why men ſeek the things of this world ſo much, is, becauſe they <hi>miude earthly things;</hi> to this the Apoſtle oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>the having our converſation in heaven,</hi> Phil. 3.21.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Think ſeriouſly upon it in time of temptation. This is a ſpecial ſeaſon; Now if ever, wee ſhould have heaven in our eye. <hi>Moſes</hi> refuſed, having reſpect unto the recompence of reward, whereby is intimated, that hee had it in his eye at that inſtant when hee was tempted to yeeld. When any buſineſs of concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is propoſed, before wee determine any thing, wee ſay, <hi>Wee will thinke upon it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now there are two things that wiſe men uſe to think on in ſuch caſes. 1 What they ſhall get on the one hand: And ſecondly, What they may loſe on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and accordingly they reſolve. Let us do ſo in this caſe, when wee are tempted to ſeek our ſelves in any baſe ſinful way, let us conſider, if wee do this, wee may haply get a little pleaſure that will laſt
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:170316:212"/>for a ſeaſon, and yet that is a queſtion; I but if wee deny our ſelves, and do it not, wee ſhall have pleaſure that indures to all eternity; if wee do it not, wee may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſe the favour of men, ſome prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c. I but if wee do it, wee ſhall ſurely loſe the favour of God, wee ſhall bee ſhut out of heaven.</p>
                     <p>The next thing here required is:</p>
                     <p n="2">2 To aim at it as our end. When a man aims at a mark, hee hath it in his eye, looks off from all other things, and fixeth his eye upon that alone. This then is another part of the Direction, <hi>Aim at the recompence of reward,</hi> that is, make it your deſign, and the ſcope of all your actions that you may attain it.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 This would make things of the world of ſmall account with us.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The good things of the world, as pleaſures, profits, and honours. See <hi>Heb.</hi>
11.9, 10-35. verſ.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The evil things of the world. <hi>Christ for the joy that</hi> was ſet before him, endured the Croſs, and <hi>deſpiſed the ſhame,</hi> Heb. 12.2. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of his manifold ſufferings, as but one light affliction, while hee looked not at the things that are ſeen, but at the things that are not ſeen, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 This would turne the ſcales in any temptation. You know a man ſets at nought all things (whatſoever they be) that
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:170316:212"/>will not further him to the attaining of his end, which his heart is ſet upon as his chief good; and therefore offer him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much, hee will not regard it, if it make not for his end; and though never ſo many difficulties way-lay him, hee makes nothing of them, that ſo hee may attain his end. Thus it is with one whoſe heart is ſet upon the
<hi>recompence of reward,</hi> though the Devil come with temptations of pleaſure or profit, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>All theſe will I give thee,</hi> yet hee prevails not ſo, when with afflictions, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 This would make us preſs forward with ſtrength of reſolution in our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an race, ſo that nothing ſhould bee able to turn us out of our way. See <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.14. Come to one that is running a race, and tell him of ſuch a merry meeting, ſuch a good bargain, &amp;c. hee will not hearken, there is no talking to him; So it is with a Chriſtian, that hath nothing more in his thoughts than that hee may come to the <hi>marke, for the price of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>

                     <p>Whenſoever one is tempted (in any ſinful way) to ſeek himſelf, faith (if it bee exerciſed) brings in ſome command or other to the contrary. Faith deals much in the commands. As it carries the ſoul out of it ſelf for ſubſiſtence, by vertue of a promiſe, ſo it carries it above and beyond (nay contrary to) it ſelf in operation and working, by vertue of a precept. Faith is the principal grace that brings the ſoul into obedience unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duties, therefore the obedience of the Goſpel, is called <hi>the obedience of faith,</hi> Rom. 16.26.

                     <p n="2">2 It makes a full diſcovery of the true minde and meaning of it. It tells, not onely that there is a command, but what it is that is commanded. It diſcovers not onely in the general, that it is a duty, but alſo in particular, wherein it lyes. It is
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:170316:214"/>not enough that wee have a command, but it muſt bee rightly interpreted. When men judge of a command by their own wiſdome, they give no other inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of it, than may accord with their own luſts, ſo making it to ſpeak as they would have it. And thus it is before faith, Men conceit they can ſerve God and themſelves too, <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>Mammon</hi> well enough, whatſoever the command ſaith to the contrary notwithſtanding. There ſeems Indeed to bee ſome contradiction, but they know how to reconcile it, by the fair and candid conſtruction that they make of it. And hence they will have to do with the command as well as others, for though in one ſenſe (they grant) it makes againſt them, yet in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which they put upon it) it makes nothing at all againſt them, if it make not for them; ſo that they often plead that for their juſtification, which is the onely thing that condemns them.
<hi>Saul</hi> interpreting the command by carnal po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, qualifies it ſo, as might ſerve his own turn, and therefore notwithſtanding the command, hee thinks hee might do as hee did; and afterwards ſtands upon it, that he had performed it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.13-20. I, but now, when faith comes, it gives the true ſenſe of the Command, and will not ſuffer carnal reaſon to bee the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, but tells the ſoul, <hi>This is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:170316:214"/>and nothing elſe.</hi> And it ſilenceth all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to the contrary, ſo that the ſoul hath nothing to ſay or plead againſt the Command in any of the ſpecialties of it, but that all is <hi>holy, juſt,</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> and muſt bee obeyed. Faith ſtops the mouth of carnal reaſon, and brings it to a <hi>non-plus.</hi> Faith brings in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with ſpiritual evidence and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration. Now a thing is then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated, when a man ſees that it muſt needs be ſo, and cannot be otherwiſe, when all objections are anſwered, and nothing left to create the leaſt ſhaddow of doubt or ſcruple concerning it, but it preſently va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth before the brightneſs of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the evidence of it. When this is done, then</p>
                     <p n="3">3 It mightily over-awes the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the authority of it. When faith hath told,
<hi>what</hi> it is, that is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it then proceeds to tell <hi>who</hi> it is that doth command. It diſcovers the ſtamp of Divine authority, the image and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a Deity deeply impreſt upon the command, and over-awes the heart with that. It uſhers in the command with a <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord,</hi> and this it ſets,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Againſt our own wills, <hi>Thy Kingdom come, Thy will bee done,</hi> is the voice of faith in the ſoul, <hi>Not my will, but thine Lord.</hi> Faith tells the ſoul, It is fit that God ſhould have his will in every thing.</p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="378" facs="tcp:170316:215"/>2 Againſt the wills of others, <hi>Wee ought to obey God rather than men,</hi> was <hi>Peters</hi> anſwer, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.29. If it bee the will of God, no matter what it is, not who bee for it, or againſt it, faith will certainly put a man upon the practice of it. Faith convinceth the ſoul what an abominable evil it is, to refuſe to obey any of Gods commands, <hi>That rebellion is as the ſin of Witchraft, and ſtubbornneſs, as iniquity and Idolatry,</hi> 1 Sam. 15.23. by which means it prevents all deliberation and conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with fleſh and blood, ſo that the ſoul is fully reſolved, preſently to do its duty come what will of it. This it doth by convincing the ſoul of the Sovereignty of God over it, which is neceſſary to Self-denial, for while a man thinks that hee is <hi>ſui juris,</hi> and that there is no Lord over him, hee will never deny himſelf, but ſerve himſelf as his laſt and higheſt end in all that hee doth. This was the reaſon why <hi>they spake vanity every one with his neighbour, with flattering lips, and a double heart,</hi> Pſal. 12.2. they ſaid, <hi>Our lips are our own, who is Lord over us,</hi> verſe 4. Now faith diſcovers the quite contrary, that there is a Lord over us, even <hi>The moſt High God poſſeſſor of heaven and earth,</hi> Gen. 14.19. and that hee hath an abſolute Sovereignty and Dominion over us, to do with us what hee pleaſeth, and to require of us what hee will.</p>
                     <p n="1">

By this means the ſoul ſees Self-denial to bee a duty as clear as the light.</p>
                     <p>Anſw. 2. <hi>Faith doth mightily convince a man of the danger if hee do not d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

This is that which very much hinders men from venturing upon this duty of Self-denial, they doubt whether it would not bee better for them to ſeek themſelves, and worſe, if they ſhould do otherwiſe. Now faith puts it out of doubt that it would not bee better, but worſe, if they ſhould ſeek themſelves, and on the contrary, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Faith doth this two wayes.</p>

                        <pb n="384" facs="tcp:170316:218"/>The Apoſtle tells us of faith, that it is <hi>the ſubstance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The ſubſtance (or ſubſiſtence) of things hoped for, it gives them a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial being long before they bee, as if they did already actually exiſt. Hence the object of faith is preſent, that is, faith conſiders it as preſent. Faith beleeves that God doth anſwer before hee anſwers. As God in anſwering, ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents our asking,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.24. <hi>Before they call, I will anſwer;</hi> ſo when faith is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, it prevents Gods anſwering. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord giveth, I know I have it. Faith reallizeth the bleſſings promiſed, before they have a being. When mercies are but in their principles, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and birth, when they are but in their cradle and ſwadling bands, faith ſpeaks as gloriouſly of them as if they were fully acted and grown up before the eye. And therefore it is,</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The evidence (or demonſtration) of things not ſeen, not onely becauſe it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends them (which neither ſenſe nor reaſon doth) but becauſe it apprehends them (and diſcovers them unto the ſoul) as cloathed upon with ſo much certainty and reality. When a man can diſcern no ground of incouragement, either by ſenſe or reaſon, faith ſpies it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. Now this hath a mighty influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:170316:218"/>on the ſoul to carry it on in a way of Self-denial. — <hi>While we look not at the things which are ſeen, but at things which are not ſeen,</hi> ſaith
<hi>Paul,</hi> We count our ſufferings but a <hi>light affliction,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.17, 18.</p>
                     <p>By this means it begets hope in the ſoul (as by the other fear) and this makes one reſolute to undertake any ſervice, though never ſo difficult, and ready to undergo any ſuffering, though never ſo dangerous, in obedience to the will of God, for his glory.</p>
                     <p>This it doth by giving the ſoul a ſight of God in theſe promiſes.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 As able, <hi>Abraham, ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbeleef, but was ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully perſwaded that what hee had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, hee was able alſo to perform,</hi> Rom. 4.20, 21.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 As faithful, to accompliſh them. <hi>Through faith alſo Sarah her ſelf received ſtrength to conceive ſeed, and was delivered of a childe when ſhee was past age, becauſe ſhee judged him faithful who had promiſed,</hi> Heb. 11.11.</p>
                     <p>Anſw. 3. <hi>Faith ſets a-work all other graces which are requiſite to bee exerciſed in any one act of Self-denial, and ſecures them in their working.</hi> This appears part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the former particular (by what hath been ſaid of fear and hope) but I ſhall ſpeak more directly and fully unto
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:170316:219"/>it in this. There is not any one act of Self-denial, but to the performance of it, there is required the acting of ſeveral graces in their kinde, ſo that if any one of theſe graces ſhould not bee acted, there would bee no acting of the reſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no Self-denial, the act of Self-denial would bee prevented. Now faith hath a mighty influence upon every grace to ſet it a work according to the nature and quality of the duty that is to bee performed, and to maintain it in its working, ſo that it ſhall prevail. I will ſhew this in theſe four particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 That to every act of Self-denial, is required the exerciſe of ſeveral gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 That if any one of thoſe which are required ſhould bee ſtopt and hindred in its acting, there would bee a ſtop of all the reſt, and conſequently no Self-denial.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 That faith hath a mighty influence to ſet all of them a work.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 That faith ſecures them in their working.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 To every act of Self-denial there is required the exerciſe of ſeveral particular graces, ſeveral graces muſt bee exerciſed in the judgement, and in the will, and in the affections. See an inſtance in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Self-denial, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25, 26, 27. of grace exerciſed,</p>

                     <p n="3">3 In his affection, <hi>Hee forſook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the King,</hi> verſ. 27.</p>
                     <p>Some acts of Self-denial conſiſts meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>in</hi> the exerciſe of grace, others are performed <hi>by</hi> the exerciſe of grace. <hi>Theſe</hi> are the inward acts of Self-denial, which are terminated within the minde, <hi>theſe</hi> are the external acts. To both are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the acting of ſeveral graces. As grace is not ſingle in its being, ſo not in its working, as there is a connexion of graces in the habit, ſo likewiſe in the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 If any one of thoſe which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, ſhould bee ſtopt and hindred in its acting, there would bee a ſtop of all the reſt, and conſequently no Self-denial. As there is a conjunction, ſo likewiſe there is a dependance of the ſeveral gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces one upon another, a conjunction in their being, and a dependance in their working, ſo that if one bee ſtopt, all the
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:170316:220"/>reſt ſtop too. As it is in a watch, if one wheel ſtop, all the wheels, when they come to the motion of that wheel ſtop too. When there is required three or four particular graces, to the making up of one and the ſame act of Self-denial, if any one of them bee wanting there is no Self-denial. As for example, If <hi>Moſes</hi> had not eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of <hi>Egypt,</hi> hee had not refuſed to bee called the Son of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daughter; if hee had not had courage to fortifie him againſt the fear of the wrath of the King, hee had never left <hi>Egypt</hi> as hee did. Thus you ſee the two firſt particulars cleared. Now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Faith hath a mighty influence to ſet all of them a-work, as many as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in any one act of Self-denial. Faith is a working grace, but herein it hath the preheminence that it is the <hi>firſt grace</hi> that ſets all the reſt a-work. Hence all the works of grace are ſaid to bee the works and fruits of faith, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Faith</hi> (ſaith St.

And hee further confirms it by the inſtance of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, <hi>Seeſt thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:170316:220"/>was faith made perfect,</hi> verſ. 21. Now leſt any ſhould think that theſe works ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, are the proper works of faith, as ſuch a particular grace (as every grace hath its proper works) it may eaſily bee ſhewn out of Scripture, that there is no good work that is not the fruit of faith. As from that <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>Without faith it is impoſsible to pleaſe God,</hi> by which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle argues, that the works of <hi>Enoch</hi> were works of faith, becauſe they pleaſed God, verſ. 5. God is pleaſed with good works,
<hi>Col.</hi> 1.10. Now if there bee any ſuch without faith, God is pleaſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith. Again, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The life that I now live, is by faith,</hi> but the life that hee
<hi>then</hi> lived was the life of grace, the life of good works which hee did not live
<hi>before,</hi> Gal. 2.20. ſo that the truth is evident. Faith is the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> as the ſpring-wheel in a Watch that ſets all the reſt a going, or as the weight in a Clock.
<hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Amor meus poudus meum, co feror quosunque feror,</hi> My love is my weight, by that I am carried whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever I am carried; But what is the weight that moves love? Why the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, <hi>That faith worketh by love,</hi> Gal. 5.6. And as for other graces, you have inſtances enough in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. All the grace that <hi>Abraham</hi> and
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp;c.</hi> exerciſed in thoſe eminent acts of Self-denial there recorded, was ſet a-work
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:170316:221"/>by faith. <hi>By faith Abraham, &amp;c. By faith Moſes, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Faith ſets grace a work proportionably to the height of the act of Self-denial that wee are called to, it doth not onely ſtir up grace, and ſet it a working, but it makes it work to ſuch a height as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the greatneſs of the preſent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igency. See a notable inſtance in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Rom. 4.19, 20. And being not weak in faith, hee conſidered not his own body now dead, and hee ſtaggered not at the promiſe through unbeleef, but was ſtrong in faith giving glory to God, and therefore <hi>againſt hope beleeved in hope,</hi> verſ.
18.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Faith ſecures them in their working. <hi>I had fainted</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>)
<hi>unleſs I had beleeved,</hi> Pſal. 27.13. It is ſaid of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that through faith <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>hee endured,</hi> Heb. 11.27. <hi>Chriſt</hi> told <hi>Peter</hi> that Satan had deſired to have him, but that hee had <hi>prayed that his faith might not fail,</hi> and therefore Satan could not have him, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts that above all things wee ſhould take unto us <hi>the ſhield of faith,</hi> Epheſ. 6.16. hee calls it a ſhield, becauſe as the ſhield doth cover all the other parts of the Armour, ſo doth faith all the other graces. In 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.8. hee calls it a breaſt-plate, becauſe it ſecures the heart, therefore hee ſaith, <hi>By faith wee ſtand,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.24.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="391" facs="tcp:170316:221"/>Anſw. 4. <hi>Faith brings in the mighty power and ſtrength of God to our aſſiſtance, and therefore muſt needs bee able to carry us through this duty of Self-denial.</hi> Though of our ſelves, in our own ſtrength, wee can doe nothing, yet in the ſtrength of God wee may doe it with eaſe. Now faith brings in Auxiliary forces from heaven, engageth the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of God with us. There is a kinde of Omnipotency in faith (<hi>all things are poſsible to him that beleeveth,</hi> Mark. 9.23.) and this is the reaſon of it. It is ſaid of <hi>Stephen,</hi> Act 6.8. that hee was <hi>full of faith and power.</hi> Where faith is, there is power, even the mighty power of God — <hi>the greatneſs of his power toward us who beleeve,</hi> Eph. 1.19. It is ſaid, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. that wee are <hi>kept by the power of God to ſalvation,</hi> but <hi>through faith,</hi> the power of God through faith. In
<hi>Matth.</hi> 9.22. <hi>Chriſt</hi> tells the woman that had an iſſue of blood, <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole,</hi> why? it was the power of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that made her whole; I but it is attributed to her faith, becauſe her faith ſet the power of <hi>Chriſt</hi> a work for that end.</p>
                     <p>Thus you ſee wherein the power of faith lyes to carry a man through this duty of Self-denial, and therefore what reaſon you have to make uſe of it in this particular.</p>

                     <p n="8">8 Hath it not hindred you from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving much good from thoſe, to whoſe precepts you ſhould have attended, and whoſe example you ſhould have imitated? It may bee, if you have been in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure obſervant as you ſhould, you may have found ſome, if not all of theſe evils; now whatſoever you have found, call it to remembrance, and whatſoever you ſhall finde, take ſpecial notice of it, that you may never forget it.</p>
                     <p>Further, conſider how this evil of Self-ſeeking in any, or all of theſe, or any other particular evils, hath at any time appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to your conſciences, as exceeding and out of meaſure ſinful; what ſtrange ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:170316:223"/>you have had of the vileneſs and baſeneſs of it, how loathſome it hath been unto you, how you have cenſured and condemned your ſelves for it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved againſt it. This would bee a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial means to prevent your relapſing for time to come. When wee have loſt our apprehenſions of the vileneſs and baſeneſs of any ſin, wee are then ready to return unto it again upon any new temptation; and wee loſe our former apprehenſions, when wee are not careful to record them in our memories, and frequently to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect them. Keep in minde</p>
                     <p>Secondly, what experiences you have had of the evil of ſuffering by it, in three particulars.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The fruſtration of your hopes. How often have you promiſed your ſelves great matters, but have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? Looked for gain, but have met with loſs; for honour, but have met with ſcorn and contempt.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The accompliſhment of your fears. You have been afraid of poverty, of ſhame, of reproach, and to avoid it have diſſembled your profeſſion, and yeelded in a baſe ſervile compliance with men of corrupt mindes, but by this means it hath come upon you.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The vexation of your ſpirits. You have been allured in time of temptation with the pleaſure of ſuch ſins; but oh,
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:170316:223"/>what an evil and bitter thing have you found it afterwards! what an hell have you had in your conſciences!</p>
                     <p>This likewiſe would bee a ſpecial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative, but men forget. <hi>A woman when ſhee is in travel hath ſorrow</hi> (ſaith our <hi>Saviour</hi>) <hi>but as ſoon as ſhee is delivered of the childe, ſhee remembreth no more the anguiſh, for joy that a man is born into the world,</hi> Joh. 16.21. When men have fallen by their iniquity, oh then you ſhall hear them promiſe and vow great matters, if ever God ſpare them, they will become new men, they will never do the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they will bee more wary for time to come; but within a while, when the fear of the preſent danger is paſt, they will bee venturing again. It happeneth to theſe according to the Proverb, <hi>The dog is turned to his own vomit again,</hi> 2 Pet, 2.22. When they are ſtomach-ſick, they caſt up their ſweet morſels with loathing and abomination, but they are no ſooner well, but they lick them up again. Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore keep freſh in your memories what an evil and a bitter thing you have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found it, to ſeek your ſelves in a ſinful way, that you may tremble at the thoughts of doing the like for time to come as long as you live. Keep in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The experiences you have had of the wayes and means whereby you have
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:170316:224"/>been drawn to it. <hi>Wee are not ignorant of Satans devices</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. but moſt times wee are forgetful of them, which is the reaſon that wee are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared the ſecond time. That which hath prevailed with you to ſelf-ſeeking hath been (it may bee) either,
<list>
                           <item>1 Some over-weening thought of your ſelves, or</item>
                           <item>2 An over-high conceit of the things of the world, or</item>
                           <item>3 Neglect of watchfulneſs, or</item>
                           <item>4 Dallying with a temptation, or</item>
                           <item>5 Hearkning to evil counſel, or</item>
                           <item>6 Following evil example.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Well, what ever it is that you have found to have been at any time the cauſe of it, keep it in remembrance; by this means you will bee the better able to ſhun it for time to come. A man that at ſuch a place hath miſſed his way, will bee ſure to remember it againſt the next time, to avoid it. One that hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by a <hi>Cheat,</hi> will know him too well to truſt him another time. Wee ſay, well, I will know you again another time for this. So ſhould wee ſay, when wee have been deceived by this or that, to ſeek our ſelves. This is the way to have skill to overcome a temptation, by this means wee ſhall bee able to eſpy the ſnare at the firſt glance, and to perceive whither the temptation tends; for Sathan comes
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:170316:224"/>with fair ſhews and pretences; a man that hath not obſerved his methods and wiles, is preſently carryed away as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſting nothing, but another that hath had experience, and taken notice of them, will alwayes ſuſpect the worſt, and therefore will bee the more wary and circumſpect.

                     <p>This will bee a good means to make you perſevere and hold on in the practice of this duty, when you can ſay you have learned by experience how good it is. <hi>Laban</hi> you know was a Self-ſeeking per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, now calling to minde what good (as hee judged) hee had found in that way, hee reſolves to hold on in it ſtill, and therefore by this argument hee endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to perſwade <hi>Jacob</hi> to tarry with him, that hee might make the moſt of
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:170316:225"/>him, as hee had done before. <hi>I pray thee</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>if I have found favour in thy eyes, tarry, for I have learned by experience, that the Lord hath bleſſed mee for thy ſake,</hi> Gen. 30.27. This was the reaſon why thoſe Idolaters were ſo peremptorily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to perſiſt in their Idolatry, <hi>to burn Incenſe to the Queen of heaven, and to poure out drink-offerings to her,</hi> Jer. 44.17. They told the <hi>Prophet</hi> they would do as they had done, they and their Fathers, their Kings, and their Princes in the Cities of <hi>Judah,</hi> and in the ſtreets of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for then they had plenty of victuals, and were well, and ſaw no evil. Now if ſelfiſh men make uſe of their experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that becauſe they have proſpered in an evil way, therefore they will go on in it, much more ſhould thoſe that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to deny themſelves. And therefore the Apoſtle to prevent the Apoſtacy of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> bids them call to minde <hi>the former dayes</hi> wherein they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied themſelves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.32. where though it bee not expreſly mentioned what good they had then found in the way of Self denial, but onely what they expected, yet it is implied, for though the greateſt part of their recompence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved till hereafter (and therefore hee doth chiefly urge them with the reſpect they had had to that, as the main thing whereby they were induced to deny
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:170316:226"/>themſelves as they did, which hee exhorts them ſtill to continue, as being the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt argument to prevail with them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere) yet they had ſomething in hand, ſeeing the reward of Self-denial is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the world to come, but in this world alſo, as was ſhewn before. This would bee a good means alſo to <hi>prevail</hi> with us to renew our practice of this duty after any back-ſliding. <hi>Then ſhall ſhee ſay, I will go and return to my firſt husband, for then it was better with mee than now,</hi> Hoſea 2.7.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, What experiences you have had of the means, whereby you have been inabled to deny your ſelves.</p>
                     <p>You have heard of a great many helps and directions, and it may bee you have found many of them true by experience, that when a temptation hath been upon you, you were almoſt gone, your feet had well nigh ſlipt; but then when you were ready to yeeld, the ſerious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the evil of Self-ſeeking kept you back; or ſuch a command, ſuch a promiſe was ſet home upon your ſpirit; or the reſpect that you had to the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward, that was it that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held you. Well, whatſoever it was, bee ſure not to forget it, keep it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance againſt a time of need, as long as you live, and reſolve to make uſe of it again and again.

This is the firſt thing meant by <hi>Walking in the Spirit,</hi> it is the ſame with <hi>Walking after the Spirit,</hi> Rom. 8.1.4. and <hi>being led by the Spirit,</hi> verſ. 14. The <hi>Spirit</hi> is ſent in purſuance of the <hi>Fathers</hi> deſign in <hi>Election,</hi> and of the <hi>Sons</hi> in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> and hee acts not only by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and converſion at the firſt, but by continual guidance and direction after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, being as a <hi>voice behinde us,</hi> ſaying, <hi>This is the way walk in it;</hi> putting us in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance when wee are forgetful, and ready to neglect our duty; warning us of the danger when wee are about to turn to the right or left hand in the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any ſin; ſtirring up in us ſuch thoughts as theſe,
<q>This is a temptation, therefore wee muſt ſhun it; This is a fit ſeaſon for ſuch a duty, therefore wee muſt

                     </p>
                     <p>As the <hi>Devil</hi> draws men unto ſin, by putting it into their hearts (as it is ſaid,

                     <p>Now if wee would follow theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit, to do our duty, wee ſhould not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh. For,</p>

                     <p n="1">1 The Scripture all along alledgeth this as the cauſe why men are given up to their own luſts. <hi>My people would not hearken to my voice, and Iſrael would none of mee; ſo I gave them up unto their own hearts luſt, and they walked in their own counſels,</hi> Pſal. 81.11,

                     <p n="2">2 The Spirit is ingaged to bee with us while wee follow his motions, ſo, that though wee bee tempted, wee ſhall not bee overcome by temptation. <hi>The Lord is with you, while you bee with him,</hi> 2 Chron. 15.2. Now as <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8.31. <hi>If God bee for</hi> (or with)

Though it doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſubdue all our corruptions, yet it inables us (if we follow him) to go on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering and to conquer; wee have our
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:170316:229"/>daily victories. It doth not ſuffer a man to ſpend his time in fruitleſs reſiſtances, but gives ſin its deaths wound, ſo that though there bee an

It roots up the ſtrongeſt and moſt deep-rooted luſts and corruptions, it levelleth the higheſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, and takes down all that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts it ſelf againſt Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Beleevers finde by experience that they are never more free from yeelding unto
<hi>Self,</hi> than when they moſt carefully follow the motions of Gods Spirit. This was one of the firſt things that I took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of in my ſelf. After a temptation had prevailed, then I could ſay, If that I had followed ſuch a good motion that I had before, I had not come to this. Whence I gathered this rule (as having found it ſo by experience) that if a man follow the motions of the Spirit, hee ſhall not bee left to fulfill the luſts of the fleſh.</p>
                     <p>Beware therefore of neglecting the motions of Gods Spirit, for by this means it is quenched, and then either,

                     <p n="1">1 It will not move at all. Before there were frequent hints and items given, ever and anon good ſuggeſtions, but now there is a ceſſation, you are ſeldome

                     <p n="2">2 If the Spirit do move, yet not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually. If the Spirit ſpeak, its onely by way of conviction, not of perſwaſion, it makes you ſenſible of your duty, but not willing to perform it.

And then how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that any one in ſuch a caſe ſhould not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh?</p>
                     <p>Oh therefore,</p>
                     <p n="1">1 If the Spirit of God move, if you have a good thought put into your minds to perform ſuch a duty, do not put it off, but cloſe with it preſently, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſay, as

                     <p n="2">2 If you would deny your ſelves, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe the graces of the Spirit.

<hi>i. e.</hi> Spiritual, which conſiſts in the exerciſe of grace. This alſo is a ſpecial preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative from fulfilling the luſts of the fleſh. A little grace well exerciſed doth much this way. <hi>Thou haſt a little ſtrength,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia, and haſt kept my word, and haſt not denied my Name,</hi> Rev. 3.8. Now if a little grace well exerciſed do thus, what will not a greater meaſure and ſtrength of grace well exerciſed do? Why conſider, the exerciſe of grace is that which makes little grace great grace, and weak grace ſtrong grace; as by trading, the Talents
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:170316:230"/>increaſed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.20. Now where grace is in its ſtrength, a man is not eaſily prevailed upon by the luſts of the fleſh, but on the contrary, where corruption is high, and grace low, there corruption doth frequently get the better, and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation uſually carries him away; And ſo it is when grace is not exerciſed, though it bee ſtrong grace, for ſtrong grace not exerciſed, doth by little and little lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and decay, as
<hi>Rev.</hi> 3.2. Now when grace is thus impaired, it is unable to reſiſt and withſtand corruption, and if grace do not withſtand it, what is there that can? And if corruption bee not withſtood, wee muſt needs bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born by it. By this it appears, how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is to bee much in the exerciſe of grace, if wee mean not to fulfill the luſts of the fleſh, for the ſoul is continually acting, and it muſt needs bee acted by one of theſe two, for this is the nature of immediate contraries (ſuch as grace and corruption are) as hath been ſhewn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, by the exerciſe of grace, the ſoul is kept in an holy, heavenly frame, and then temptations are not ſo ſuitable; The Devil, that obſerves the ſeaſon for a temptation, takes that for the fitteſt, when our hearts are out of frame, then hee will bee ſure to ſet upon us; but when our hearts are kept in a holy frame and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:170316:231"/>temper, hee cares not ſo much to meddle with us, becauſe then hee hath no ſuch hopes of prevailing. Therefore bee much in the exerciſe of grace in every action, in every condition, in every duty both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and man, in every creek and turning of your converſation.</p>

Well, conſider what hath been the iſſue? Hath not this refuſal to ingage, brought you within a while to a total omiſſion of the duty?

                     <p n="1">1 By our Saviour himſelf, <hi>Take my yoak upon you, and learn of mee, for I am meek and lowly in heart,</hi> Matth. 11.29.
